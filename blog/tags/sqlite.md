Founder @ Curling IO

We're building the next version of Curling IO - same features, same experience, stronger foundation. After over a decade of serving hundreds of curling organizations across Canada, the US, and internationally, we're investing in technical upgrades that set Curling IO up for the next 20+ years.

This is the first in a series of technical posts documenting our journey and decisions as we build.
