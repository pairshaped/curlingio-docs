## What is Premium Tier?

Premium tier is a way for us to reward clubs that are supporting Curling I/O financially, whether via Online Payments or by purchasing supporter packs.

Premium tier clubs will have access to benefits that non-premium clubs will not. The list of premium benefits may expand over time.

There is no obligation to join our premium tier.
The premium tier benefits are conveniences and non-essential to your use of Curling I/O for event management and curler registration.

It may seem a little complicated, but that's because we wanted to design the premium tier system so that even smaller two-sheet clubs can maintain access if they are accepting online payments.
As long as you are accepting online payments, even if your monthly volume is low, you should be able to maintain premium tier access without ever needing to purchase a supporter pack.

## Accessing Premium Tier

Premium tier access is based on your clubs premium balance.
As long as you maintain a premium balance above zero, your club has premium tier access.

Newly on-boarded clubs start with 600 premium points, which is equivalent to 3 months of premium tier access.

If your club is accepting online payments, then a pecentage of every online payment is automatically added to your premium balance as premium points.
Premium points from online payments are awarded on a scale, where the less you already have, the more you will receive.

If you are not accepting online payments then you can still gain access to premium tier by purchasing one of our supporter packs:
* **600** premium points for **$60.00**. (3 months)
* **1,200** premium points for **$114.00**. (6 months at a 5% discount)
* **2,400** premium points for **$216.00**. (12 months at a 10% discount)
* **9,600** premium points for **$768.00**. (48 months at a 20% discount)

You can check your club's premium balance and purchase premium tier points at any time through your Curling I/O admin area.
Select the **Club** dropdown menu in the top navigation bar and then select **Premium**.

We subtract 200 points from your premium balance every month to pay for premium tier access.
If your premium balance reaches zero, then your club is no longer considered premium tier and will lose access to premium tier benefits.
Your balance will never go below -199, so even a club who depletes their premium balance during the offseason, can quickly regain premium tier access once they start accepting online payments next season.

**There are no refunds for premium points. Premium points have no real world monetary value and cannot be redeemend or traded.**

## Premium Tier Benefits

The following benefits are only available to premium tier clubs:


### Priority Support

Premium tier clubs are prioritized when submitting support tickets.

Non premium tier clubs are still able to submit support tickets, but it may take longer to receive a response (hey, it's free!).


### Email Marketing

**COMING SOON**

Premium tier clubs will be able to send emails to your members and create segments to target specific members.
For example, marketing emails like "Join our Spring Bonspiel!"

Simply by belonging to our premium tier, you can send up to 2,000 emails per month.
This should be more than enough for most if not all clubs.

You may purchase an additional 2,000 emails for 100 premium points should you need to exceed this limit in a given month.

Non premium tier clubs can still download / export their curler lists and use third-party tools like MailChimp, ActiveCampaign, and Constant Contact.


### Rental Ice Booking

**COMING SOON**


### Quick Books Online Integration

**COMING SOON**


### Self-scoring by Curlers

**COMING SOON**

Premium tier clubs can enable self-scoring for their leagues and competitions.
Self-scoring means that curlers will be able to login and score their own games.

## Referrals

You can earn one years worth of premium points by referring another club to Curling I/O if they end up using our platform.
