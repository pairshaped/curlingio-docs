## What is Premium Tier?

Clubs who subscribe to our premium tier have access to exclusive benefits.
Clubs who are not subscribed to our premium tier will still have access to Curling I/O's core functionality.
There is no obligation to join our premium tier.

Our premium tier as designed so that even small two-sheet clubs will maintain premium access as long as they are accepting online payments.

**PREMIUM TIER LAUNCHES IN JULY 2024**


## Accessing Premium Tier

Premium tier access is based on your clubs "premium balance" which represents how many months of premium access you have.
As long as you maintain a balance above zero, your club will maintain premium tier access.
Your premium balance is decremented every month.

Newly on-boarded clubs start with a premium balance of 3 months.
If your premium balance reaches zero then you lose access to premium tier.

If your club is accepting online payments, then a pecentage of every online payment is automatically added to your premium balance.
These percentages from online payments are awarded on a scale, where the less you have, the more you will receive.
Even if a small club depletes their premium balance during the offseason, they will quickly regain premium tier access once they start accepting online payments next season.

If you are not accepting online payments then you can still gain access to premium tier by purchasing one of our supporter packs:
* **6** months for **$120.00**.
* **12** months for **$228.00**. (5% discount)
* **24** months for **$432.00**. (10% discount)

You can check your club's premium balance and purchase supporter packs at any time through your Curling I/O admin area.
Select the **Club** dropdown menu in the top navigation bar and then select **Premium**.

**There are no refunds for premium months. Premium months have no real world monetary value and cannot be traded.**
