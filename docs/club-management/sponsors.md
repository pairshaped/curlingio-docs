You can create reusable sponsors that can be associated with leagues, competitions, products, pages, and articles.

When a member views the details of any of these items, the sponsor logo will be shown along with it's name.

Curling I/O will keep track of how many times a sponsor has been viewed and how many times it has been clicked (if a URL has been provided).

## Finding Sponsors

Within your admin area, click on the **Club** dropdown menu in the top bar and then click on **Sponsors**.

## Fields

### Name

The name is required and will be shown below the sponsor logo / image. For example: "Brought to you by ACME Inc."

### Logo

The logo is required and will be shown on the detail page of any leagues, competitions, products, pages, or articles that use the sponsor.

### URL

The URL is optional. If a URL is provided, when a member clicks the sponsor logo they will be sent to the URL provided. Curling I/O will track how many times a sponsor has been clicked.

### Active

You can temporarily disable a sponsor logo by deactivating it. You can still associate a deactivated sponsor to leagues, competitions, products, pages, and articles, but it will no longer be shown to your members.

## Deleting Sponsors

To remove a sponsor, click the **Delete** link next to it. This will also remove it from any of it's associations.
