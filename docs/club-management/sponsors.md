**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium)**

You can create reusable sponsors that can be associated with leagues, competitions, products, pages, and articles.

When a member views the details of any of these items, the sponsor logo will be shown along with it's name.

Curling IO will keep track of how many times a sponsor has been viewed and how many times it has been clicked (if a URL has been provided).

## Finding Sponsors

Within your admin area, click on the **Club** dropdown menu in the top bar and then click on **Sponsors**.

To update an existing sponsor, click the **Edit** link next to it.


## Fields

### Name

The name is required and will be shown below the sponsor logo / image. For example: "Brought to you by ACME Inc."

### Logo

The logo is required and will be shown on the detail page of any leagues, competitions, products, pages, or articles that use the sponsor.

### URL

The URL is optional. If a URL is provided, when a member clicks the sponsor logo they will be sent to the URL provided. Curling IO will track how many times a sponsor has been clicked.

### Active

You can temporarily disable a sponsor logo by deactivating it. You can still associate a deactivated sponsor to leagues, competitions, products, pages, and articles, but it will no longer be shown to your members.

## Deleting Sponsors

To remove a sponsor, click the **Delete** link next to it. This will also remove it from any of it's associations.


## Troubleshooting

We noticed after launching this sponsors feature that a popular browser extension called "uBlock Origin" may hide the sponsor logo upload (preventing you from creating a sponsor).
If you are experiencing this issue, we highly recommend disabling the extension for Curling IO.
We don't embed any thiird party advertising within Curling IO anyways, so ad block extensions like uBlock provide no benefits on our site.
