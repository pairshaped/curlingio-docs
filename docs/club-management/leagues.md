## Instructional Video

The following video will take you through the basics of creating a league and opening up registrations.
Competitions are identical except that for a competition you will usually not require a curler profile, as they will be team based registrations.

## The Basics


### Naming your League or Competition

This is the name that will be displayed to your members when they come to register on Curling I/O.

For leagues we recommend including the Day of the week, night or day, and type of league here. E.g. "Monday Night Men's".

Some clubs will also include the year, but this is generally unecessary and entirely at your preference since leagues and competitions are filtered by season when member's visit see their listing pages. E.g. "Monday Night Men's - 2020"


### Start & End Dates

The start and end dates indicate when your league or competition runs.
These aren't to be confused with when the league or competition registration opens and closes.


### Summary & Description

When you enter a summary, it will show up on the list view of your leagues or competitions when members come to Curling I/O.
For leagues, we recommend entering your draw times. E.g. 7:00 & 9:00 PM

The description shows up when your members click on the name of the league or competition and also when they assigned a curler profile or fill in required information for it.
Keep in mind that member's may just add the league or competition to their cart without clicking on it's name.


### Sponsorship

You can optionaly upload a sponsor image and provide a Sponsored By line. This will only appear in the detailed view of your league or competition when member's click on the name.

## Registration


### Open & Close Dates

You must specify an open and a close date before your members can register for the league or competition.
This determines when it is available for registration / purchase.

Before the open date has occurred, members will be shown that date that registration will open.

Once the close date has passed, members will be shown that registration is closed.


### Pricing & Tax

When you set the pricing for your league or competition, we highly recommend breaking out the tax, both for transparency to your members, but also to make it easier for your bookkeeping.

There is a handy tax calculator which will show you what your total with tax will be in case you want to untangle taxes from your existing pricing.

For league registrations you will also want to break out the affilaite fees and let Curling I/O handle them for you.
If you inlcude the affiliate fees as required in the [Addons section](#assigning-fees--addons) then Curling I/O will ensure that every curler who registers for the league will also pay the affiliate fees.
We also make sure they only pay them once per season, by ommiting seasonal fees in future league registrations for the same season.
It's also much easier to report on for bookkeeping and when it comes to figuring out your club's remittance.

## Copying a League for the new Season

In Curling I/O you **NEVER reuse leagues or competitions across multiple seasons**.
We keep the previous season's leagues and competitions for their historical data. This is useful for reporting / accounting, but also for curler's to see results and standings from a previous season if you are using our [event management features](/docs/event-management/registrations).

Instead what you'll want to do is simply **Copy** your leagues and competitions from the previous season.
The **Copy** option is found next to each of your leagues and competitions in their respective list views.

When you copy a league or competition, you are presented with a pre-filled form.
The start, end, registration open, and registration close dates will be prefilled with one year added to each of them.
You will want to tweak these dates to make the weekday's line up for the new season.
You will also want to remove the "(Copy)" from the name (we do this to make it obvious you are copying).

Usually that's all you'll need to do to setup your leagues and competitions for the new season.


## Who Registered / Purchased a League or Competition?

You can click the **Purchases** link next to one of your existing leagues or competitions. It will take you to our reports session filtered by the league or competition.
This will show you all of the registrations for it.
