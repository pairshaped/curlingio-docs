You can modify some of the core settings for your club in the settings section.

Within your admin area, click on the **Club** dropdown menu in the top bar and then click on **Settings**.

![Settings Navigation](/img/docs/club-management/settings/navigation.png)


## Basic Settings

### Name

The name of your club shows up in the top left of the navigation bar on all screens as well as your contact page.

### Languages

Curling I/O supports both English and French at this time.
If you have both languages selected, your curlers will be able to switch between languages on the fly, and you will be able to enter both english and french content (titles and descriptions) throughout the admin section.

### Landing Page

This tells Curling I/O which section to default to when someone visits your Curling I/O site.

### Website Hosting

We offer a very limited and simple website hosting option at this time, and we encourage you to try it out to see for yourself.

When you check the "Are we hosting your website?" option, you will see two new entries in your admin area; **Pages** and **Articles**.
You can create as many pages and articles as you like, and you can even gate pages and articles to members only or even members who have paid for a specific fee.

More details about this feature can be found in the [website hosting section.](/docs/club-management/website-hosting)

### Brand Colour

You can change the color of buttons and links from the default red by entering a different color hex value here.
To find the hex value you like, just enter "color picker" into Google.

### Logo

You can upload your logo and a smaller version of your logo that will be shown to the left of your club name in the top left of the top navigation bar.

### Summary

The summary should be a short description of your club and will be shown in our public [Find a club](https://clubs.curling.io) section.


## Venue

If you provide venue information it will be used as defaults when managing your events (leagues and competitions).


## Location

The location information requires no explanation, but please do check it over and make sure we have the correct address and time zone for your club.


## Contact Information

The contact information you enter here will be shown on your contact page.
If you enter a Twitter or Facebook account we will link to it from your contact page.


## Payments

You can choose whether or not to accept payments online and offline.
This is a club-wide setting and cannot be specified at a league, competition, or product level.
If you haven't set your club up with our online payment processor yet, the **Can be paid online** option is ignored until you do.
This is due to the fact that a curler may purchase multiple leagues, competitions, and products at the same time.

If you optionally provide your tax identifier (Business Number in Canada), we'll include it on the receipts sent to your curlers when they make a purchase.
This is rarely required, but we have seen cases where registrants needed a tax identifier for expense purposes.


## Integrations

Currently we provide a Mailchimp integration.

Mailchimp is a separate service (not provided by Curling I/O) that enables you to send out marketing emails and email blasts to your curlers.
By entering your API Key and an Audience ID Curling I/O will automatically populate your Mailchimp mailing list (audience) with your curlers as they register.
We also tag your curlers in Mailchimp with the item they purchased (like the name of a league) so that you can segment your email campaigns.
For example to send an email to everyone who registered for the Monday Night Men's league.

You can have up to 2,000 subscribers (curlers) registered in your Mailchimp account free of charge, and send up to 12,000 email per month.

## Tags

Tags are used to make it easier for your curlers to search a large number of leagues and competitions.
We don't recommend using tags unless you have multiple pages worth of leagues or competitions that curlers must search through.
