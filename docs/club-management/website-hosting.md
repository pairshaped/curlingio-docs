Need a modern club website but tired of paying for WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace? Curling IO Hosting gives every club a polished web presence at no extra cost, fully integrated with the rest of the platform.

Open the **Website** section in your admin navigation to manage everything in one place—changes publish the moment you save:

* A customizable landing page activates the instant you enable it, giving visitors a polished overview without extra work.
* Pages and articles you add appear instantly, and the public site automatically surfaces Pages or News menus when content is available.
* A club-wide customizable colour palette (including call-to-action buttons).
* Member-only visibility controls, letting you lock sensitive announcements or resources to active curlers in a couple of clicks.
* Tight integration with registrations, leagues, bonspiels, programs, and products—no copy/pasting data between systems.

Because it is built into Curling IO, the hosting experience stays simple, secure, and easy for volunteers to maintain. Explore the live demo club at <https://demo.curling.io/> to see the layout, navigation, and content options you can launch right away.

## Landing Page[​](#landing-page "Direct link to Landing Page")

The landing page is an optional hero-style layout that opens your site with key calls to action. Enable it from the **Website → Landing Page** settings to swap it in immediately, then fine-tune the content inline.

Editable blocks cover the entire experience:

* **Hero**: Title, tagline, and rich media (YouTube video or uploaded image) to welcome visitors.
* **At a Glance**: Bullet points that summarize hours, amenities, or quick facts.
* **About Our Club**: Short narrative with an optional supporting image.
* **Sections**: Summaries for Leagues, Bonspiels, Programs, Products, and Calendar, each linking directly to its catalog. These summaries are also added as intro text to their respective sections, just below the header.
* **Quick Links**: Buttons that take visitors to common tasks such as membership, bookings, or volunteer sign-up.
* **Testimonials**: Social proof from members or guests.
* **News**: Pulls the three most recent articles to keep the page fresh.
* **Sponsors**: Displays partner logos in a clean carousel with a sponsorship call-to-action.

You can edit copy in place—click the Edit link for any section to update the content and see changes instantly.

## Pages[​](#pages "Direct link to Pages")

Each page has a title, a position (order), whether or not it's published (or a draft), an optional image, and the body content.

You can *restrict* individual pages so that they can only be seen by members. You can even specify the product or fee they must have purchased in order to see a page. By default, pages are unrestricted.

Similar to event and product descriptions, the body content of your page is entered using [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) or HTML.

## Articles / News[​](#articles--news "Direct link to Articles / News")

Each article has a title, the date when it should be published, an optional image, and the body content. The order in which articles appear is based on the published date (most recent first).

You can *restrict* individual articles so that they can only be seen by members. You can even specify the product or fee they must have purchased in order to see an article. By default, articles are unrestricted.

## Banner[​](#banner "Direct link to Banner")

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

You can upload a banner image that will be shown along the top of your public site. Aim for dimensions near 1200 x 250 pixels; other sizes are resized automatically when uploaded.

You can also choose whether it shows up only on the Pages and Articles sections or across the entire site. We recommend against displaying it everywhere since it takes up a significant amount of screen space.

## Sidebar[​](#sidebar "Direct link to Sidebar")

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

The sidebar is where you can "tout" other content on the right side of the Pages and Articles screens.

You can select which touts should appear in the sidebar for pages and articles.

You can also enable or disable the sidebar for individual pages and articles.

Touts are 300-pixel-wide rectangles.

### Current Games Tout[​](#current-games-tout "Direct link to Current Games Tout")
