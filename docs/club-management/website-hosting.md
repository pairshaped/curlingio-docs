## Overview

Curling I/O comes with an extremely basic (no frills) and free integrated website hosting option allowing you to publish pages and articles within your Curling I/O website.
We do not provide custom domains, navigation menu customization, or advanced styling options.

Most clubs are already hosting their website with a third party like Wordpress, Wix, Squarespace, Weebly, etc. Curling I/O website hosting is entirely optional and disabled by default.

If our *no frills* approach meets your club's requirements you can eliminate a third party hosting expense, and a potentially intimidating learning curve (I'm looking at you Wordpress!).

Please see https://demo.curling.io/ for an example of what this looks like.

Our website hosting option will remain *no frills* for the foreseeable future. Our rational is threefold:

1. There are hundreds of website hosting businesses out there already with some pretty extensive features. We simply can't compete with them and still maintain our focus on curling specific features.
2. Occasionally a club will end up with a complicated website hosting platform, and then years later due to staff churn, struggle with updating and maintaining it. This is especially a problem with some of the most popular platforms like Wordpress, where being out of date has security implications.
3. We believe that pages, articles, leagues, competitions, and products encompass most, if not all, of what your members are looking for when they visit your website.


## Turn On / Off Website Hosting

To enable website hosting:

1. Click on "Settings" in the top left "Club" menu.
2. Check the "Are we hosting your website?" option.
3. Click on "Save"

Once enabled you will see "Pages" and "Articles" in the top navigation.

You can disable this at any time simply by unchecking the same checkbox.

You can also change the landing page for your Curling I/O to have it point to your pages (the first page in your pages collection).

## Pages

Add as many pages as you like and specify the order that they appear in.

You can *restrict* individual pages so that they can only be seen by paying members, or even specify the product or fee they must have purchased in order to see a page.
By default pages are unrestricted.

The content of your pages are entered using markdown or HTML. (http://chibicode.github.io/markdown-toolbar-cheatsheet/)


## Articles / News

Add as many articles as you like. The order they appear in is chronological based on the publish date you enter when creating the article.

You can *restrict* individual articles so that they can only be seen by paying members, or even specify the product or fee they must have purchased in order to see an article.
By default articles are unrestricted.

The content of your articles are entered using markdown or HTML. (http://chibicode.github.io/markdown-toolbar-cheatsheet/)

## SEO

Any pages and articles you create will be published in your sitemap.xml (used by search engines like Google) and have appropriate meta tags and titles.
