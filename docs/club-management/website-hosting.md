## Overview

Curling I/O comes with an extremely basic (no frills) and free website hosting option allowing you to publish pages and articles within your Curling I/O website.
We do not support custom domains, navigation menu customization, stylsheet customization, or cycling banners.

Website hosting is entirely optional and disabled by default.
Most clubs are already hosting their website with a third party like Wordpress, Wix, Squarespace, Weebly, etc. and we're OK with that.

If however, our *no frills* approach meets your club's requirements you can eliminate a third party hosting expense, and a potentially intimidating learning curve (I'm looking at you Wordpress!).

Our website hosting option will remain *no frills* for the forseeable future. Our rational is twofold:

1. There are hundreds of website hosting businesses out there already with some pretty extensive features. We simply can't compete with them and still maintain our focus on curling specific features.
2. Occasionally a club will end up with a complicated website hosting platform, and then years later due to staff churn, struggle with updating and maintaining it. This is especially a problem with some of the most popular platforms like Wordpress, where being out of date has security implications.


## Turn On / Off Website Hosting

To enable website hosting:

1. Click on "Settings" in the top left "Club" menu.
2. Check the "Are we hosting your website?" option.
3. Click on "Save"

Once enabled you will see "Pages" and "Articles" in the top navigation.

You can disable this at any time simply by unchecking the same checkbox.

## Pages

You can add as many pages as you like and specify the order that they appear in.

You can also *restrict* pages so that they can only be seen by paying members, or even specify the product or fee they must have purchased in order to see a page.
By default pages are unrestricted.


## Articles

You can add as many articles as you like. The order they appear in is chronological based on the publish date you enter.


## Intentionally Missing Features

There's a whole range of features you'll find in most other content management systems / website hosting platforms, that are not included with Curling I/O.

This is by design. We want to keep it as simple as possible for our clubs. It's possible we may add some additional features down the road, but we'll always be focused on keeping it as simple as possible.

* No separate custom CSS files.
* No separate custom JavaScript files.
* No drag and drop page builders.
* No navigation menu customization.
* No fancy cycling new / image widgets.
* No document uploads.
* No image galleries (under consideration)
