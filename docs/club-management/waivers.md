Curling IO by default will ask your curlers to accept a waiver during registration, but only once per season.
We also keep a snapshot of the waiver that was accepted for future reference if it's ever needed.
These snapshots along with which waivers have been accepted can be found in the [Reports section](/docs/club-management/reports).

These default waivers come from Curling Canada's Business of Curling program and are intended for Curling Clubs.

You can customize or even replace these waivers for your own custom text. You can also deactivate or delete these waivers if you'd rather manage the waiver process in person at the club.

You can create additional waivers, but please keep in mind that every wall of text your curlers need to accept causes registration friction.

Waivers are specific to your club and are only required once per season per curler and only when a curler profile is being required. They are not event specific.


## Editing Waivers 

You can find your waivers within the admin area.
Click on the **Club** dropdown menu in the top bar and then click on **Waivers**.

You should see three waivers listed:
* Adult
* Youth

To customize a waiver, simply click the **Edit** link next to it.

### Name

This is the name of your waiver. This won't show up in the actual waiver, but it will identify which waivers have been accepted when curlers view their profiles. Please try to stick to one short word to identify the waiver.

### Acceptance
You can change the text that must be typed to accept the waiver. By default this is "I agree" for adult (over the age of majority), and "We agree" for youth (under the age of majority) waivers.

### Min and Max Age
You can change your age of majority cutoff by editing the min age and max age. These are inclusive, so a min age of 18 will include 18 year olds and a max age of 17 will include 17 years olds.

### Active

You can then choose whether or not the waiver is enabled by checking the **Active** checkbox.
The default waivers are active by when your Curling IO instance is created.

### Body text

To customize the content of your waiver, just edit the **Body Text** of the waiver.
We use a popular format named **markdown** for text editing.
Markdown allows you to add basic formatting to text.
You can also use HTML to format the body text.
