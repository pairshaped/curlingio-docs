**[Venue / Ice Booking is Premium Only](/docs/getting-started/premium)**

The calendar allows you, the curling club manager, to display your draw schedules, schedule custom events, and allow members to book rentals.

You can enable and disable the calendar in your [club settings](/docs/club-management/settings#calendar).

If you are logged in as an administrator and go to the public Schedule section, then you can edit your club's calendar settings, venues, and reserve dates for closures and other events.

Tutorial video and detailed documentation coming soon!
