# Item Recommendations

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

Item recommendations help your members discover related leagues, programs, and products during registration. When a member adds an item to their cart and fills in the required information, they'll see suggestions for other items they might be interested in.

For example, if someone registers for a beginner league, you can automatically suggest your beginner clinic program or recommend equipment like a slider or broom.

## How It Works[​](#how-it-works "Direct link to How It Works")

After a member adds an item to their cart and completes the necessary information (like selecting which family member is registering), they'll be shown up to 3 recommended items on a special recommendations page.

From this page, they can:

* View details about each recommended item
* Add any of these items directly to their cart with a single click
* Continue to checkout when they're ready

This makes it easy for members to discover programs and products they might not have known about, and helps you increase registration and sales.

## Setting Up Recommendations[​](#setting-up-recommendations "Direct link to Setting Up Recommendations")

To enable recommendations for your leagues, programs, or products, you'll add **Recommendation Keywords** when creating or editing the item.

### Adding Recommendation Keywords[​](#adding-recommendation-keywords "Direct link to Adding Recommendation Keywords")

1. When creating or editing a league, program, or product, look for the **Recommendation Keywords** field in the registration section
2. Enter keywords that describe the item, separated by commas
3. Choose keywords that reflect the type, skill level, or audience for the item

**Examples:**

* For a beginner league: `beginner, social, recreational`
* For a competitive league: `competitive, advanced, experienced`
* For a junior program: `junior, youth, kids, beginner`
* For a broom in your pro shop: `equipment, beginner, supplies`
* For a club social event: `social, fun, entertainment`

### Best Practices for Keywords[​](#best-practices-for-keywords "Direct link to Best Practices for Keywords")

* **Be descriptive**: Use words that clearly describe what the item is about
* **Be consistent**: Use the same keywords across similar items so they recommend each other
* **Think like a member**: What words would someone use to describe this item?
* **Use 3-5 keywords**: You don't need many—focus on the most relevant ones
* **Mix categories**: Include skill level (beginner, advanced), type (social, competitive), and audience (youth, adult) as appropriate

### Example: Multi-Session Leagues[​](#example-multi-session-leagues "Direct link to Example: Multi-Session Leagues")

Many clubs split their leagues into multiple sessions throughout the year (Fall, Winter, Spring). Recommendations are perfect for encouraging members to register for additional sessions.

**Scenario:** You have three sessions of the same league:

* Monday Night Open - Fall
* Monday Night Open - Winter
* Monday Night Open - Spring

**Setup:** Give all three leagues the same keywords: `monday, open`

**Result:** When a member registers for the Fall session and completes their registration information, they'll see recommendations for the Winter and Spring sessions. This makes it easy for them to sign up for multiple sessions at once, increasing retention throughout your season.

This same approach works for:

* Day vs. evening sessions of the same league type
* Different skill levels on the same night (Monday Beginner, Monday Intermediate, Monday Advanced)
* Related programs running in different time blocks

## How Recommendations Are Selected[​](#how-recommendations-are-selected "Direct link to How Recommendations Are Selected")

When your members see recommendations, the system looks for other active items that:

* Share similar keywords with what they just added
* Are available for registration (not closed or full)
* Match eligibility requirements (age, gender) if applicable
* They haven't already registered for

Items with more matching keywords will appear first in the recommendations.

## When Recommendations Appear[​](#when-recommendations-appear "Direct link to When Recommendations Appear")

Recommendations will only appear when:

* The item being added has recommendation keywords set up
* There are other eligible items with matching keywords
* The member hasn't seen recommendations for this item before

If a member edits an item in their cart that previously showed recommendations, they won't see them again—this prevents interrupting their checkout experience.

## Items Without Keywords[​](#items-without-keywords "Direct link to Items Without Keywords")

If you don't add recommendation keywords to an item:

* It won't trigger recommendations when someone registers for it
* It won't appear as a recommendation for other items
* It will work normally in all other ways

This gives you complete control over which items participate in the recommendation system.

## Tips for Success[​](#tips-for-success "Direct link to Tips for Success")

**Start with your most popular items**: Add keywords to your busiest leagues and programs first, then expand from there.

**Cross-promote thoughtfully**: If you have a beginner league and a beginner skills clinic, use matching keywords so they recommend each other.

**Don't forget products**: Add keywords to pro shop items like equipment, apparel, and supplies so they can be recommended alongside leagues and programs.

**Review and adjust**: After a few weeks, see which items are frequently added together and refine your keywords to improve recommendations.

**Keep it simple**: You don't need a complex keyword strategy—start with obvious descriptors like skill level and type of activity.
