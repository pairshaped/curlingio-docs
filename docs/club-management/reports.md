Curling I/O produces a lot of reports that give you insight into the financials and membership at your club.

You can find the Reports section by clicking **Reports** in the top navigation bar.

![Reports Navigation](/img/docs/club-management/reports/navigation.png)

All of the reports can be filtered by date range and sometimes other varying options, like payment status or method.


## Downloading Raw Data

All of the reports can be downloaded as CSV files.
CSV stands for "Comma Separated Values" and it's a standard format supported by Excel, Google Sheets, MS Access, and all other spreadsheet, database, and accounting software programs.

The downloaded data will always include more fields than what is shown on the screen, and we highly recommend using it for your own accounting purposes.
Just click the **Download** button at the bottom of the screen on any of your reports.
If you are running any filters, like a date range, then the downloaded data will reflect those filters.
