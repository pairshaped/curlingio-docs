Custom fields allow you to ask any question you like during registration or purchase of one of your leagues, competitions, or products.

If for example, you'd like to know the name of a team's coach during registration for one of your bonspiels, or whether it's a curler's first time curling at your club, you can create custom fields for these questions.
You can even have a custom field for a coupon code and then tie a discount to it.

After creating a custom field you still need to choose which leagues, competitions, and products you want to associate it with, since we won't assume it should be asked for all of your leagues, competitions, and products.


## Finding Custom Fields

Within your admin area, click on the **Club** dropdown menu in the top bar and then click on **Custom Fields**.

## The Basics

### The Type of Custom Field

You can use different types of custom fields:

#### Text Box

The most common field type.
This is a short free form text box.

For example, _Contact Name_ or _Contact Phone_.

#### Text Area

This is a larger free form multiline text box.

For example, _Comments_ or _Notes_.

#### Dropdown

This is a dropdown field restricting a members choice to just the values you provide.
Note that when selecting **Dropdown**, a **Possible Values** option will appear where you need to enter the values to populate the dropdown with.

For example, _Number of Players on the Team: Three, Four, Five, Six_ or _First Time Curler?: Yes, No_.

#### Check Box

This is a check box useful for yes or no questions.

**Important:** when associating a checkbox custom field to a league, competition, or product, if you make it required, then everyone will need to check it off.

#### Date

This will prompt members to enter a date using a series of dropdowns.

For example, _Date of Certification_.

#### Attachment

This will prompt members to upload an attachment.

**Caution:** Executables and documents could contain a virus, and you are responsible for scanning your own attachments after downloading them.


### Naming your Custom Field

This is the name that will be displayed to your members when they are asked to fill it in during registration.


### Hint

This is a brief description that will be displayed below your custom field when members are asked to fill it in.
You can include any instructions here if necessary.


## Deleting Custom Fields

To remove a custom field, click the **Delete** link next to it.
