# The Dashboard

When a curling club manager first logs in to the administrator area of Curling IO they will be presented with the dashboard. On the dashboard they will see a collection of statistics meant to give a quick summary of the current season.

By clicking on any of these dashboard links, the curling club manager will be taken to their relevant section or report.
