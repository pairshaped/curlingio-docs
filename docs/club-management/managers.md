Clubs can have multiple managers for Curling IO.
Each of the managers is granted the same level of access.

If you want to give access to an outside party for just a specific league or competition, then you don't add them as a club manager.
[You can find information about event managers here](/docs/event-management/event-managers).


## Finding Managers

You can access the list of all the managers at your club, by clicking on **Managers** in the top right **Club** dropdown in the top navigation bar.

## Adding Managers

You can add another manager to your club by entering their name and email address into the form at the top of the screen and clicking the **Create Manager** button.

Curling IO will send an email to the email address entered inviting them to join the club management (admin) area.
The email will contain a link to the admin dashboard.

We recommend managers bookmark the admin area to avoid confusion between the public and administration sections of your Curling IO site.


## Removing Managers

We highly recommend that you remove staff from your Curling IO management when they are no longer with the club.
You can do so by clicking the **Delete** link next to the manager you wish to remove.
This doesn't delete their account, as they may have profiles and participate in leagues themselves, but it does remove them from your club management.
