If you are not [using Curling I/O to host your website](/docs/club-management/website-hosting), you'll still want to link to your Curling I/O site for registrations.
You'll need to do this in order for your members to find the Curling I/O registration.

This is a very straightforward process. Simply add a "Register Online" button to your existing website, linking it to your public facing Curling I/O site.

You can also leverage our widget, but it will require a little more technical knowledge, or access to someone technical who can assist you.

## Code Example

```
<a href="https://club-name.curling.io">Register Online</a>
```

** Replace `club-name` with your curling I/O URL. E.g. https://demo.curling.io
