The Curling I/O registration and results widget enables you to embed your leagues, competitions, and products, along with their schedules and results within your existing website.

## Setup

To proceed, first you'll need to know how to edit an HTML file so you can copy and paste the necessary code in to your website.

We've provided a sample HTML file you can use as a reference to embed our registration and results widget:

[Example HTML with Instructions](https://github.com/pairshaped/curlingio-results/blob/master/example.html)

You can save this HTML file locally, open it in a browser, and make tweaks to the source to test out changes if you like. Then, once your happy with it, take the result and embed it into your website.

You will also need your API Access Key, which can be found in your [Club Settings under Integrations](/docs/club-management/settings).

[Full installation instructions can be found in the README on Github](https://github.com/pairshaped/curlingio-results)
