# Registration and Results Widget

Curling IO provides two widgets you can use to embed your leagues, competitions, and product data on your website.

* The registration and results widget shows your leagues, competitions, and products, along with their schedules, results, and registration links. You would typically embed this widget on it's own dedicated page on your website.
* The current games widget shows the list of games that have just finished, are currently being played, or are starting soon. You would typically embed this widget in a small square on your home page.

## Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

To proceed, first you'll need to know how to edit an HTML file so you can copy and paste the necessary code in to your website.

The full instructions to embed the widgets can be found here: <https://github.com/pairshaped/curlingio-results/tree/master#readme>

We've also provided sample HTML files you can use as a reference to embed the registration and results widget and the current games widget.

* [Registration and Results Example HTML with Instructions](https://github.com/pairshaped/curlingio-results/blob/master/example.html#L13-L54)

* [Current Games Example HTML with Instructions](https://github.com/pairshaped/curlingio-results/blob/master/current-games-example.html#L13-L36)

You can save these HTML files locally, open them in a browser, and make tweaks to the source to test out changes if you like. Then, once your happy with it, take the result and embed them into your website wherever you like.
