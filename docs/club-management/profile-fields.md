### Greyed out Fields

The fields that are greyed out are required by the system for various operations like waivers, gender restricted events, and age restricted events / fees / discounts.
You cannot change these fields.

### Required

If you specify that a field is required, then curlers must fill it out when registering and creating a curler profile.

### Optional

If you specify that a field is optional, then curlers will be asked, but may choose not to fill it out when registering and creating a curler profile.

### Don't Ask

If you specify that a field is don't ask, then curlers will not be asked to fill it out when registering and creating a curler profile.

### Missing Fields?

If there are fields that you need to collect but are missing, then you can [submit a feature request to discuss it on our feedback board](https://curling.canny.io/).

Profile fields shouldn't be specific to just one club.
Also, temporal fields like **age** or **first time curler** cannot be asked as part of a curler profile since they wouldn't remain accurate from season to season, but would be fine to ask via custom fields on your events.
