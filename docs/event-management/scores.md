This will open up the game window.

## Scoring a Game

With the game window open, you can click the button for who won or lost, which will automatically select the opposite option for the opponent.
You can optionally enter a score if you want to keep track.

## End Scores

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium)**

If end scores are enabled for your league or competition, you'll be presented with more options:

![End Scores](/img/docs/event-management/scores/end-scores.png)

* Scoring each end.
* Setting which team has the first hammer (last shot in first end).
* Choosing the rock color for each team.
* If a game is tied after all ends have been played (10), we will keep adding new ends until one team scores, or until you set the result to "Tied".
