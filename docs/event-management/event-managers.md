## Walkthrough Video

The following video will take you, the curling club manager, through the basics of granting access just to the event features for a league or competition.
If you're new to Curling I/O, it's worthwhile to watch this before wading through the rest of our documentation.

## Finding the Event Managers Section

You can grant a user restricted access to manage specific leagues or competitions without letting them to the rest of your club's administration area.
For example if you had a commercial league that was managed by someone who isn't a club staff member, or you wanted to grant only game scoring access to a tablet at the club.
To get to the event managers screen, first click on the name of a league or competition.

You should then see a list of tabs near the top.
Click on the **Event managers** tab.

## Adding an Event Manager

You can also restrict what they'll have access to by checking / unchecking the different sections listed.

When done, click the **Create Event manager** button and an email will be sent to the email address provided letting them know that they now have access to manage the league or competition.
A link to manage the league or competition is included in the email.
