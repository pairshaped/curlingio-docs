# Event Managers

## Walkthrough Video[​](#walkthrough-video "Direct link to Walkthrough Video")

The following video will take you, the curling club manager, through the basics of granting access just to the event features for a league or competition.

## Finding the Event Managers Section[​](#finding-the-event-managers-section "Direct link to Finding the Event Managers Section")

You can grant a user restricted access to manage specific leagues or competitions without letting them to the rest of your club's administration area. For example if you had a commercial league that was managed by someone who isn't a club staff member, or you wanted to grant only game scoring access to a tablet at the club. To get to the event managers screen, first click on the name of a league or competition.
