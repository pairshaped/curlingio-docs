### Groups[​](#groups "Direct link to Groups")

* You can have one or more groups in a bracket. Usually these would be named "Group 1", "Group 2", or "A Event", "B Event", etc.
* Edit a group's name by clicking the pencil icon next to it.
* Click the group's name to collapse or show it's grid of games.
* Add new groups by clicking the "Add Group" button at the bottom of the screen.
* Remove a group on it's edit screen if it's empty (has no games).
* You can connect game results between brackets. For example, you could have a B event where teams that have lost play each other, and the winner of the B event could play the winner of the A event in a consolation game.

### Games[​](#games "Direct link to Games")

* Add new games by double clicking on a blank area within a group.
* Click the red ✘ in the top right corner of a game to remove that game.
* Move games around by clicking the header of the game (where the game name is), holding down, and dragging the game to a new location. You can even drag games between groups.
* Double click on a game to edit it and / or assign teams.
* Click and drag a game's green "W" (winner) or red "L" (loser) circle icon to a game position (top of bottom slot) of another game to connect the potential winner or loser to their next game. For example you can click the green "W" of a semifinal game and drag it to the top slot of the final game.
* The grid will automatically grow or shrink as you move games near it's edges.
