The curlers screen for an event will list all of the curlers who registered for the event.
From here you can add curlers who didn't register for the event, as long as they have a curler profile and have been associated with your club (accepted a waiver or registered).
For example, curlers who opted to spare for the event.

To get to the curlers screen, first click on the name of a league of competition.

You should then see a list of tabs near the top.
Click on the **Curlers** tab.

Some scenarios where you might want to add curlers who didn't register for en event:

1. It was a team registration and you want to add all of the curlers that were mentioned in each team's lineup.
2. The curler opted to spare for the event and you'd like to place them on a team.
3. The curler was exempt from registration for some other reason and you'd like to place them on a team.

When you click the **Add curlers** button you will be taken to a screen listing all of the curlers in your club who have not already been added (or registered for) the event.

You can search to find the curler(s) you want to add, then simply click the **Add** button next to the curler(s).

When you're done, click the **Back** button to verify the added curlers are now showing up for your event.
