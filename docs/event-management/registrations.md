# Registrations

You can manage the registrations for each of your leagues or competitions. To get to the registrations screen, first click on the name of a league or competition.

You will then see a list of tabs near the top. Click on the **Registrations** tab.

From this screen you can download a CSV file of your events registrations, and you can edit the registrations themselves.

A scenario where you might want to edit a registration, is if you are asking for a **Team name**, **Skip name**, or **Lineup**, and need to correct an entry due to a typo or convention. For example, say there are four registrations for the same team, the first entered *"Jones"*, the second entered *"Team Joness"*, and the last two entered *"Team Jones"*. You can edit the first two registrations to have them all have *"Team Jones"* for the team name. This will come in handy later when you are assembling the teams.
