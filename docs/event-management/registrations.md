You can manage the registrations for each of your leagues or competitions.
To get to the registrations screen, first click on the name of a league or competition.

![Events List](/img/docs/event-management/shared/events.png)

You will then see a list of tabs near the top.
Click on the **Registrations** tab.

![Registrations Navigation](/img/docs/event-management/registrations/navigation.png)

From this screen you can download a CSV file of your events registrations, and you can edit the registrations themselves.

A scenario where you might want to edit a registration, is if you are asking for a **Team name**, **Skip name**, or **Lineup**,
and need to correct an entry due to a typo or convention. For example, say there are four registrations for the same team, the first
entered _"Jones"_, the second entered _"Team Joness"_, and the last two entered _"Team Jones"_.
You can edit the first two registrations to have them all have _"Team Jones"_ for the team name.
This will come in handy later when you are assembling the teams.
