If your club has enabled the sparing feature for any of their leagues you will be able to select which of them you are available to spare for, whether to publish your contact information, and any other notes you'd like to include.

1. Go to your "Profiles" screen, by clicking the "Account" menu at the top right of the screen and then the "Profiles" link. If you don't see an "Account" menu, you must log in first.
2. You should now see a list of curler profiles. Next to each curler profile you will see a "Sparing" link. Click on it.
3. Select the leagues and competitions you are willing to spare for. Your name and optionally your contact information, preferred positions, and any notes will then show up on the spares list for the selected leagues and competitions for other curlers and club staff to see.
