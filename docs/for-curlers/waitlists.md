If room or inventory becomes available and club staff approve your waitlist registration, you'll be sent an email with a special link and instructions to purchase the league, competition or product.
You will likely have a limited amount of time to claim your waitlisted item before your club moves on to the next person in line.

**Note:** Your waitlist approval allows you to register for exactly one spot. If you try to add multiple quantities to your cart, extras will be automatically removed.

## Canceling Your Waitlist Registration

If you're no longer interested in the league, competition, or product, you can cancel your waitlist registration so the next person in line may join.
