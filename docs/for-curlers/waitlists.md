# Waitlists

Once a league, competition, or product runs out of space or inventory, you may be presented with an option to join it's waitlist. When you do so, your waitlists will appear on this screen.

1. Login first, if you aren't already signed in.
2. Click on the "Account" dropdown near the top right of the screen.
3. Click on the "Waitlists" link in the Account dropdown.

If room or inventory becomes available and club staff approve your waitlist registration, you'll be sent an email with a special link and instructions to purchase the league, competition or product. You will likely have a limited amount of time to claim your waitlisted item before your club moves on to the next person in line.

**Note:** Your waitlist approval allows you to register for exactly one spot. If you try to add multiple quantities to your cart, extras will be automatically removed.

## Canceling Your Waitlist Registration[​](#canceling-your-waitlist-registration "Direct link to Canceling Your Waitlist Registration")

If you're no longer interested in the league, competition, or product, you can cancel your waitlist registration so the next person in line may join.
