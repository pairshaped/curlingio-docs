# My Teams

Once your profile(s) has been assigned to a team in a league or competition, that team will show up in this section. If you don't see any teams here, that may just mean the club hasn't assigned your profile to any teams yet.

When you click on a team name, you will be taken to a list of games that your team is participating in. If your club has enabled **participant scoring** for the league or competition then you will be able to submit scores and results for games you played within the last week.
