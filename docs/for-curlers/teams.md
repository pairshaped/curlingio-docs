Show the list of teams one or more of your profiles belong to.
If you don't see any teams, that may just mean the club hasn't assigned your profile to any teams yet (and might not plan to either).

When you click on a team name, you will be taken to a list of games that your team is participating in.
If your club has enabled "participant scoring" for the league or competition then you will be able to submit results for games that were played within the last week.
