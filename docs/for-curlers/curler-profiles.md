# Curler Profiles

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

Curler profiles in Curling IO are persistent and can be used again for future registrations in the same or future seasons or even at other clubs or membership associations without needing to re-enter all of your information.

You can also create profiles for your children or someone you are a legal guardian for, all on the same account.

When creating a profile if you have more than one email address, you can enter them in the primary and secondary email address fields. Doing so, will ensure that if you accidentally login with one of these alternative email addresses, you will still be able to see and use your profile for registrations.

## Creating a Curler Profile[​](#creating-a-curler-profile "Direct link to Creating a Curler Profile")

If you've never registered with Curling IO before then you'll most likely be asked to create a new profile. Once you've created a profile it will be available for all future registrations (no need to keep keying in the same information).

Just follow the instructions and fill in the required information to continue.

After creating your profile you may be asked to accept one or more waivers specific to your club before you can continue.

## Updating a Curler Profile[​](#updating-a-curler-profile "Direct link to Updating a Curler Profile")

If you previously registered for a league, competition, or product you probably have a profile in our system. You can make changes to your profile at any time following these steps.

Make sure you login with the same email address you used to create the profile, or an email address that is associated with the profile (primary or secondary email for the curler). If you aren't, then you won't be able to see or make changes to your curler profile.

1. Login first, if you aren't already signed in.
2. Click on the "Account" dropdown near the top right of the screen.
3. Click on the "Profiles" link in the Account dropdown.
4. Click on "View Profile" for the profile you want to edit.
5. Click on the "Edit" button at the bottom of the screen.
