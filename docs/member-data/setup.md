## Overview

**This document is only relevant to membership associations.**

As a membership association, any of your clubs that are using Curling IO for registrations are collecting membership data that you can access in your member reports.

For clubs that are not yet using Curling IO you can ask them to easily import their membership data using Curling IO by following the instructions in this document.


## Club Setup

Membership association managers are able to login and access the member import area for clubs who are not yet using Curling IO for registrations.

You can access each club's member import area though the Clubs report.

1. Click on "Reports" in your top navigation bar.
2. Click on the "Clubs" report.
3. Click on the non-active club (active just means they are using Curling IO for registrations)
4. Login using the same account you are using to access your membership association's admin area.

You should now see the member import screen for the club.

You will want to add one or more of the club's managers so that they can also access this area and upload their membership data.

1. Click on the "Managers" link in the top navigation bar.
2. Enter the manager's name and email address.
3. Click the "Create Manager" button.

The new manager will receive an email with instructions on how to access Curling IO (this member import area).

These managers can now upload their seasonal membership data directly to Curling IO and this data will be available in your "Members" report.


## Checklist

- [Add club specific managers](/docs/club-management/managers) to each of your non-active clubs so they can upload their membership data every season.
- Make sure each of these clubs watch the [member data  import tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yPdn-sGWuQ&t=1s).
- You are responsible for supporting these non-active clubs, so please make sure you also watch the [member data import tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yPdn-sGWuQ&t=1s).
- Make sure your clubs know that Curling IO also provides [registration and event management features they can use for free!](/docs/getting-started/curling-club-managers)
