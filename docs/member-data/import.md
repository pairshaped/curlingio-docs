# Import Member Data

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

The member data import feature lets you easily upload your member data for your membership association. If you want to use this member data import feature please contact your membership association who will get you set up.

**NOTE:** This feature is only for clubs that are not yet using Curling IO to handle their registrations. If you are an affiliated Canadian curling club already using Curling IO for registrations then the reporting of your member data to your membership association is handled automatically.
