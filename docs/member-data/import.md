## Existing Curling I/O Clubs

This member data import feature is only for clubs that are not yet using Curling I/O to handle their registrations.
If you are already using Curling I/O for registrations then reporting on your member data is handled automatically.

The member data import feature allows you to upload your spreadsheet member data for your membership association.
Please contact your membership association first to get set up.

You also need to make sure the headers in your spreadsheet exactly match the headers in the example spreadsheet.

- For Apple Numbers, click ```File -> Export To -> CSV...```
