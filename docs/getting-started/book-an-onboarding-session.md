The goal of an onboarding session is to get your leagues, fees, discounts, and products setup to mirror your club's operations, and answer any questions you may have.

We require that attendees have reviewed our tutorial videos and documentation prior to booking an onboarding session.

We cannot run multiple sessions for your club due to key stakeholders not attending, so please make sure everyone involved has some familiarity with us and present during your onboarding session.

The onboarding process is a screenshare where we walk through your setup with you in real time and make sure you're ready to start taking registrations by the end of it.
Multiple stackeholders can and should attend the same session.
