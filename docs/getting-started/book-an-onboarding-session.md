The goal of an onboarding session is to get the leagues, fees, discounts, and products setup to mirror your club's operations, and answer any questions you may have.

**We require that attendees review our tutorial videos and documentation prior to booking an onboarding session.**
The assumption is that you're ready to get started using Curling I/O.

The onboarding process is a screenshare where we walk through the club setup with you in real time and make sure you're ready to start taking registrations by the end of it.
Multiple stakeholders can and should attend the same session.

Please understand that we cannot run multiple onboarding sessions for your club due to key stakeholders not attending.
Everyone who will be using our platform should have some familiarity with Curling I/O (please have them watch some videos) and be present during your onboarding session.

Select one of the times below to book your onboarding session.
