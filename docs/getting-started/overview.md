Curling I/O is the best in class curling club management and registration platform brought to you by Curling Canada.
Our focus is to make it easy for clubs to manage both their registration online and manage their leagues.

We also have extremely affordable (and simple) pricing for clubs of all sizes, with no monthly or setup fees.

## Online Registration

Curling I/O was built from the ground up to manage curler registration.
It's intuitive and seamless for curlers of all ages to use season after season.
In fact, our national curler database makes it even easier to register again after the first season as they won't need to rekey all of their information.

We also make it easy for clubs to accept payments online.
We integrate with the industry leader, extremely secure, and well regarded payment processor [Stripe](https://stripe.com/).
It only takes around 5 minutes to get your club setup for online payments.


## League and Competition Management

We've developed some innovative features to help you manage your leagues and competitions.

- Automated team recommendations and assembly.
- Round robin generation.
- Drag and drop playoff bracket builder (coming soon)
- Draw schedule generation with manual override.
- Curler opt-in spares engine.
- Game scoring.
- Results publication.
- Extensive permissions system for third parties to manage your leagues and competitions.

Curling I/O manages the competitions for membership associations across Canada and for Curling Canada.
If you've ever checked the scoreboard for the Brier's or Scotties on [curling.ca](https://www.curling.ca/scoreboard), then you've already seen Curling I/O in action.


## Bookkeeping and Reports

We have an extensive reports section that bookkeepers love.

Our reports help you figure out your taxes on registrations and really dig down into the data to see how your club is performing financially.
