We offer two options to upgrade to our premium tier:

1. **Enabling online payments will automatically upgrade your club to our premium tier.**
2. If you don't want to accept online payments, you can still unlock premium tier with a yearly $420 flat fee.

## How can we offer all of these essentials for free?

It's simple really. We have an extremely robust and optimized multi-tenant infrastructure that minimizes the per-club costs of our essential feature set.
We don't need to perform a bunch of setup tasks, or spin up new servers when we add a club.

In addition, everytime an online payment is processed through Curling IO, we get to keep a sliver of the processing fees.
With so many clubs, we're able to generate enough revenue to subsidize the infrastructure costs of our *free clubs* while also paying for new feature development.

## Online Payments and Fees

### Canadian Clubs

**2.9% + $0.30 per online credit card transaction**. Includes standard VISA and MasterCard processing fees.
This is our hybrid rate which allows you to also accept and track offline payments (when members pay you later by cheque) free of charge.

We also offer a discounted rate of **2.7% + $0.30 per online credit card transaction** to clubs that choose to **only accept online payments**.

**No setup fees, period.**

**Processing Details:**
- Our rate includes all standard credit card processing fees
- Payments clear within 7 days via direct deposit
- Only VISA and Mastercard accepted (including co-branded debit cards)
- [Convenience fees](/docs/club-management/settings#convenience-fee--surcharge) can be passed on to members at your discretion (check your local laws)

**Additional Fees:**
- Disputes (chargebacks) - rare in curling, detailed in payment agreement
- International credit cards may have additional fees

**Offline Payments:**
- Completely free - no processing fees
- Members select "Pay at club" during registration
- You collect and log payments manually in Curling IO


#### Example Fees for Online Payments

Here are a few examples to help you visualize the cost of online transactions.

##### $500 purchase

`$500 x 2.9% + 30c = $14.80`

`$500 x 2.7% + 30c = $13.80`

##### $1,000 purchase

`$1,000 x 2.9% + 30c = $29.30`

`$1,000 x 2.7% + 30c = $27.30`


### Clubs in the United States
