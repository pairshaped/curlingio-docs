# Support and Feedback

We offer three options available for help and support with Curling IO.

## Online Documentation[​](#online-documentation "Direct link to Online Documentation")

Our online documentation and F.A.Q. should be your first stop if you're having trouble with one of our features.

You're on our online documentation site right now! Documentation topics are found in the left hand navigation.

## Email Support[​](#email-support "Direct link to Email Support")

We realize every club is unique and on occasion issues may present themselves.

[You can submit support requests directly from your Curling IO administrator area.](/docs/club-management/support.md)

## Feedback[​](#feedback "Direct link to Feedback")

We also have a feedback board where you can submit feature requests and vote on feature requests that other clubs and curlers have submitted.

If your request starts with *"It would be nice if..."* or *"Can you add..."* then it's probably a feature request!

[You can access our feedback board here.](https://curling.canny.io/)
