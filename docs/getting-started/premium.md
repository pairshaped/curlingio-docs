## What is Premium Tier?

**There is no obligation to join premium tier, and all clubs retain access to Curling I/O's core functionality regardless.**
However, clubs who belong to our premium tier gain access to exclusive premium features.

If your club is not accepting online payments there will be an option to purchase one year of premium access for your club.
Upon purchase, premium features are unlocked for all of your club's users.

- Only purchasable by clubs who are NOT accepting online payments.
- Not a subscription and will not auto-renew.
- Need to purchase it again every year to continue using premium features.
- There is a 2 month window where you can re-purchase before it expires, and have another year added to your expiry date.
- **There are no refunds for premium tier.**
