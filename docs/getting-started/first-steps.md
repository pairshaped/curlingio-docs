Curling I/O is a curling club management and registration platform brought to you by Curling Canada.

Here are the steps to follow when evaluating if the Curling I/O platform is a fit for your club.

## 1. Review our Tutorials and Documentation

During your onboarding session, the primary focus should be on how best to set it up for your club.
Curling I/O is a very flexible platform, and the time it takes can vary significantly from club to club due to differences in membership fees, leagues, and discounts.
That being said, for the vast majority of curling clubs it's extremely quick and simple to get you up and running.

In order to keep the costs of running Curling I/O to a minimum, and thus offer incredibly low pricing to our clubs, we insist that you first review our documentation and tutorial videos before you book an onboarding session.

You can find all of our documentation here by navigating through the left sidebar.

Please make sure that all key stakeholders review our documentation and tutorial videos and are present during your onboarding session.
We cannot run multiple sessions for your club due to key stakeholders not attending.

## 2. Understand our Pricing

Our pricing is simple and straightforward: **2.9% + $0.30 per online payments**, which **includes credit card processing fees**.
