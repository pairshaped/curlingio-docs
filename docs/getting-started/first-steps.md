Curling I/O is the best in class curling club management and registration platform brought to you by Curling Canada.
We make it easy for clubs to accept member registrations online, manage your draw schedules, and collect and track affiliate fees.

Here are the steps to follow when evaluating if Curling I/O is a fit for your club.

## 1. Review our Videos and / or Documentation

During your onboarding session, the primary focus should be on how best to set it up for your club.
For the vast majority of curling clubs it's extremely quick and simple to get you up and running, however Curling I/O is a very flexible platform, and the time it takes can vary from club to club due to differences in membership fees, leagues, and discounts.

A great place to start that is relevant for all clubs is the [Leagues and Competitions Section.](/docs/club-management/leagues)
