Curling IO is the #1 curling club management and registration platform.
Our focus is to make it easy for curling club managers to take registrations online and manage their leagues.

We also have extremely affordable (and simple) pricing for clubs of all sizes, with no monthly or setup fees.

## Online Registration

Curling IO was built from the ground up to manage curling club registrations.
It's intuitive and seamless for curlers of all ages to use season after season.
In fact, our national curler database makes it even easier to register again after the first season as they won't need to rekey all of their information.

We also make it easy for clubs to accept payments online.


## League and Competition Management

We've developed some innovative features to help curling clubs manage their leagues and competitions.

- Automated team recommendations and assembly.
- Round robin generation.
- Drag and drop playoff bracket builder.
- Draw schedule generation with manual override.
- Curler opt-in spares engine.
- Game scoring.
- Results publication.
- Extensive permissions system for third parties to manage your leagues and competitions.

Curling IO manages the competitions for membership associations across Canada and for Curling Canada.
If you've ever checked the scoreboard for the Brier's or Scotties on [curling.ca](https://www.curling.ca/scoreboard), then you've already seen Curling IO in action.


## Bookkeeping and Reports

We have an extensive reports section that curling club managers and bookkeepers love.

Our reports help you figure out your taxes on registrations and really dig down into the data to see how your club is performing financially.


## First Class Support and Documentation

Curling IO provides email support.

We also have feedback boards, online documentation (right here), and video tutorials to get you up and running.
