We offer three options available for help and support with Curling I/O.

## Online Documentation

Our online documentation and F.A.Q. should be your first stop if you're having trouble with one of our features.

You're on our online documentation site right now! Documentation topics are found in the left hand navigation.

## Email Support

We realize every club is unique and on occasion issues may present themselves.

We offer email support for all of our clubs on an ongoind basis through the Curling Canada Help Desk.
[You can submit a support request for Curling I/O here.](https://help.curling.ca/hc/en-us/requests/new)


## Feedback

We also have a feeback board where you can submit feature requests and vote on feature requests that other clubs and curlers have submitted.

If you request starts with _"It would be nice if..."_ or _"Can you add..."_ then it's probably a feature request.
