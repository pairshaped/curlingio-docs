Our pricing is simple and the same for every club. You won't find a better deal.

**2.9% + $0.30 per transaction for online payments only**

**No setup fees**

**No monthly fees**

**No fees for offline payments**

## Notes

2.9% + $0.30 means that for any online payments you accept, 2.9% of the amount of the payment plus $0.30 will come off of **your** end of every online payment.
So if it's a $100 payment you will only receive $96.80 when it's deposited.


The 2.9% + $0.30 includes all credit card processing fees. There are no other fees or costs incurred.

You **cannot** pass this fee to your members directly due to credit card processing rules and conventions. This fee will come out of your payout (direct deposit) automatically.

There are **NO FEES** for offline payments. This is when a member registers at your club using Curling I/O selects the "Cash / Cheque" option. You are responsible for collecting offline payments and logging those payments against your orders in Curling I/O. Offline payments cost you nothing but your time (to collect and log).

Online payments can take up to 7 days before they are cleared and available for payout (direct deposit).

## Example Fees for Online Payments

Here are a few examples to help you visualize the cost of online transactions.
The majority of this cost is paid to the credit card processor.

### $100 purchase

`$100 x 2.9% + 30c = $3.20`

### $200 purchase

`$200 x 2.9% + 30c = $6.10`

### $500 purchase

`$500 x 2.9% + 30c = $14.80`

### $1,000 purchase

`$1,000 x 2.9% + 30c = $29.30`
