## Canadian Clubs

Our pricing is simple and the same for every club in Canada.

**2.9% + $0.30 per transaction** for online payments.

**No setup fees.**

**No monthly fees.**

**No fees for offline payments.**

### Notes

2.9% + $0.30 means that for any online payments you accept, 2.9% of the amount of the payment plus $0.30 will come off of **your** end of every online payment.
So if it's a $100 payment you will only receive $96.80 when it's deposited.

The 2.9% + $0.30 includes all credit card processing fees. There are no other fees or costs incurred.

You **cannot** pass this fee to your members directly due to credit card processing rules and conventions. This fee will come out of your payout (direct deposit) automatically.

There are **NO FEES** for offline payments. This is when a member registers at your club using Curling I/O selects the "Cash / Cheque" option. You are responsible for collecting offline payments and logging those payments against your orders in Curling I/O. Offline payments cost you nothing but your time (to collect and log).

Online payments can take up to 7 days before they are cleared and available for payout (direct deposit).

International credit cards incur additional fees with our payment processor, resulting in a 3.4% + $0.30 fee. You can optionally let us know if you do not want to accept international cards (forcing members to pay using other means).

We can't offer the same price for U.S. base clubs, simply because we don't have a volume discount w/ our payment processor in the U.S yet. If you are a U.S. based club, please contact us for details: support@curling.io.

### Example Fees for Online Payments

Here are a few examples to help you visualize the cost of online transactions.
The majority of this cost is paid to the credit card processor.

#### $100 purchase

`$100 x 2.9% + 30c = $3.20`

#### $200 purchase

`$200 x 2.9% + 30c = $6.10`

#### $500 purchase

`$500 x 2.9% + 30c = $14.80`

#### $1,000 purchase

`$1,000 x 2.9% + 30c = $29.30`


## Clubs Outside of Canada

Our pricing is simple and the same for every club outside of Canada.

**3.6% + $0.35 per transaction** for online payments.

**No setup fees.**

**No monthly fees.**

**No fees for offline payments.**

### Notes

3.6% + $0.35 means that for any online payments you accept, 3.6% of the amount of the payment plus $0.35 will come off of **your** end of every online payment.
So if it's a $100 payment you will only receive $96.05 when it's deposited.

The 3.6% + $0.35 includes all credit card processing fees. There are no other fees or costs incurred.

You **cannot** pass this fee to your members directly due to credit card processing rules and conventions. This fee will come out of your payout (direct deposit) automatically.

Online payments can take up to 7 days before they are cleared and available for payout (direct deposit).

We would love to offer our international clubs the same pricing as our canadian clubs, but unfortunately it's not up to us. Each country results in a separate agreement with our payment processor. If we are ever able to negotiate a lower rate in your country, we will pass those savings on to you.
