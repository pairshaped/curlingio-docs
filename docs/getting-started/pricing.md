We offer two options to upgrade to our premium tier:

1. **Enabling online payments will automaitcally upgrade your club to our premium tier.**
2. If you don't want to accept online payments, you can still unlock premium tier with a yearly $420 flat fee.

## How can we offer all of these essentials for free?

It's simple really. We have an extremely robust and optimized multi-tenant infrastructure that minimizes the per-club costs of our essential feature set.
We don't need to perform a bunch of setup tasks, or spin up new servers when we add a club.

In addition, everytime an online payment is processed through Curling IO, we get to keep a sliver of the processing fees.
With so many clubs, we're able to generate enough revenue to subsidize the infrastructure costs of our *free clubs* while also paying for new feature development.
