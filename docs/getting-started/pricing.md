## How can we offer all of these essentials for free?[​](#how-can-we-offer-all-of-these-essentials-for-free "Direct link to How can we offer all of these essentials for free?")

It's simple really. We have an extremely robust and optimized multi-tenant infrastructure that minimizes the per-club costs of our essential feature set. We don't need to perform a bunch of setup tasks, or spin up new servers when we add a club.

In addition, everytime an online payment is processed through Curling IO, we get to keep a sliver of the processing fees. With so many clubs, we're able to generate enough revenue to subsidize the infrastructure costs of our *free clubs* while also paying for new feature development.
