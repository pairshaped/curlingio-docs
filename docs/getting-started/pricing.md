## Canadian Clubs

Our pricing is simple and the same for every club in Canada.

**2.9% + $0.30 per transaction** for online payments.

**No setup fees.**

**No monthly fees.**

**No fees for offline payments.**

### Notes

2.9% + $0.30 means that for any online payments you accept, 2.9% of the amount of the payment plus $0.30 will come off of **your** end of every online payment.
So if it's a $100 payment you will only receive $96.80 when it's deposited.

The 2.9% + $0.30 includes all credit card processing fees. There are no other fees or costs incurred.

You **cannot** pass this fee to your members directly due to credit card processing rules and conventions. This fee will come out of your payout (direct deposit) automatically.

There are **NO FEES** for offline payments. This is when a member registers at your club using Curling I/O selects the "Cash / Cheque" option. You are responsible for collecting offline payments and logging those payments against your orders in Curling I/O. Offline payments cost you nothing but your time (to collect and log).

Online payments can take up to 7 days before they are cleared and available for payout (direct deposit).

International credit cards incur additional fees with our payment processor, resulting in a 3.4% + $0.30 fee. This is usually only a concern if you're running a large competition in which competitors are coming in from other countries.

Only VISA and Mastercard are currently accepted (or debit cards with their co-branding). Other cards incur additional fees for our clubs, so we've opted to disable them for the time being.

### Example Fees for Online Payments

Here are a few examples to help you visualize the cost of online transactions.
The majority of this cost is paid to the credit card processor.

#### $100 purchase

`$100 x 2.9% + 30c = $3.20`

#### $200 purchase

`$200 x 2.9% + 30c = $6.10`

#### $500 purchase

`$500 x 2.9% + 30c = $14.80`

#### $1,000 purchase

`$1,000 x 2.9% + 30c = $29.30`


## Clubs in the United States

Our pricing is simple and the same for every club in the United States.

**3.6% + $0.35 per transaction** for online payments.

**No setup fees.**

**No monthly fees.**

**No fees for offline payments.**

### Notes

3.6% + $0.35 means that for any online payments you accept, 3.6% of the amount of the payment plus $0.35 will come off of **your** end of every online payment.
So if it's a $100 payment you will only receive $96.05 when it's deposited.

The 3.6% + $0.35 includes all credit card processing fees. There are no other fees or costs incurred.

You **cannot** pass this fee to your members directly due to credit card processing rules and conventions. This fee will come out of your payout (direct deposit) automatically.

We would love to offer our US based clubs the same pricing as our canadian clubs, but unfortunately it's not up to us. Each country results in a separate agreement with our payment processor.

Only VISA and Mastercard are currently accepted (or debit cards with their co-branding). Other cards incur additional fees for our clubs, so we've opted to disable them for the time being.
