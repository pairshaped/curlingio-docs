# The Next Version of Curling IO

February 12, 2026 ·

Dave Rapin

Founder @ Curling IO

We're building the next version of Curling IO - same features, same experience, stronger foundation. After over a decade of serving hundreds of curling organizations across Canada, the US, and internationally, we're investing in technical upgrades that set Curling IO up for the next 20+ years.

This is the first in a series of technical posts documenting our journey and decisions as we build.

## How This Affects You[​](#how-this-affects-you "Direct link to How This Affects You")

**For club managers:** Curling IO isn't changing from your perspective. We're upgrading the technical infrastructure behind the scenes - no downtime, no disruption, no action required from you. Your data stays exactly where it is. When the upgrade is complete (thoroughly tested and proven), the transition will be seamless. You'll have the same Curling IO you know, even faster and more reliable.

**For curlers:** You won't notice the technology change. Registration, scoring, schedules, results - everything works the same way. You might notice things feel snappier, especially during peak registration times or when checking live scores at major competitions.

## Why a New Foundation?[​](#why-a-new-foundation "Direct link to Why a New Foundation?")

Curling IO has been serving curling clubs since late 2014. We upgraded the platform once already in 2019, and our v2 system has been running successfully on Rails ever since. Everything works, clubs are happy, and growth is strong. So why invest in a new foundation?

Because we're planning to be here for the long haul. This new foundation ensures Curling IO can serve curling clubs not just for the next few years, but for the next 20+ years. While competitors come and go, we're investing in infrastructure built to last and evolve with the sport.

**Three key reasons:**

1. **AI Agent APIs** - We're adding new APIs specifically designed for AI agents to work with easily. Your existing web interface isn't changing - these are additional capabilities on top of what you already use. As AI assistants become ubiquitous (whether you love them or not), we're designing for that reality. Users are already asking ChatGPT and Claude to help them register for leagues or check schedules - we want those interactions to work reliably.

2. **Concurrency and correctness** - As the platform grows, we need stronger guarantees around correctness and performance. We want a tech stack that can handle massive concurrency - both during peak registration periods and during large traffic spikes for scoring and results at provincial and national competitions like the Scotties and Brier. It needs to eliminate entire classes of runtime errors and scale efficiently as the sport grows.

3. **Easier developer onboarding** - We want a codebase that's easy to hand off between developers. Type safety and functional patterns make code self-documenting - new developers (with help from AI coding assistants) can jump in and contribute safely without deep institutional knowledge. Gleam's deterministic patterns are much easier for AI assistants to reason about than dynamic languages, which means faster onboarding and more productive collaboration between developers and their AI tools. This significantly reduces key-person dependency.

## Choosing the Tech Stack[​](#choosing-the-tech-stack "Direct link to Choosing the Tech Stack")

Given our goals - agent-native APIs, clean architecture, and rock-solid reliability at scale - we need a stack that can deliver:

**What we're looking for**

* **Type safety** - Catch errors at compile time, not in production
* **Massive concurrency** - Handle thousands of simultaneous registrations without breaking a sweat
* **Functional patterns** - Predictable, testable code that developers can reason about
* **Shared types** - Same data structures on client and server
* **Proven at scale** - Battle-tested in production by major companies

**Why Gleam?**

[Gleam](https://gleam.run) checks every box. It's a type-safe functional language that compiles to both Erlang (for the server) and JavaScript (for the client). You get:

* **[BEAM VM](https://www.erlang.org/blog/a-brief-beam-primer/) reliability** - The same runtime that powers WhatsApp (billions of messages with \~50 engineers) and Discord (millions of concurrent users). Built-in fault tolerance and lightweight processes.
* **ML-family type system** - Stronger than Elixir, catches entire classes of bugs at compile time
* **[Lustre](https://lustre.build) for frontend** - An [Elm](https://elm-lang.org)-architecture framework for Gleam that compiles to JavaScript. We already love Elm for our current frontend apps, and Lustre brings that same architecture everywhere. Same types from database to UI, all type-safe.
* **Simple language** - Focused, consistent, easy to reason about. Perfect for building deterministic APIs.

**What about other options?**

We didn't jump straight to Gleam. We seriously considered other functional, type-safe stacks:

**[PostgREST](https://postgrest.org) + Elm/Lustre** - This was a very serious contender using tools we're already familiar with. PostgREST provides instant APIs from your PostgreSQL schema, and Elm/Lustre provides type-safe UI. But we'd need something else for background jobs (like Go), and the tooling for building, debugging, and testing PostgreSQL functions isn't great. The multi-language setup felt fragmented.

**[F# SAFE Stack](https://safe-stack.github.io)** - F# is a fantastic functional language with a solid .NET ecosystem. The SAFE stack (Suave/Saturn, Azure/AWS, Fable, Elmish) offers full-stack type safety with The Elm Architecture (TEA) on the frontend. We really liked this option, but ultimately chose Gleam for its BEAM VM benefits and simpler deployment story.

**BEAM was the killer feature.** None of these other options came close to what the BEAM VM offers: rock-solid concurrency, fault tolerance, and proven scalability (WhatsApp, Discord, etc.). Gleam gives us BEAM on the backend with familiar functional patterns (like Elm) on the frontend, all in a single language. That combination was unbeatable.

**Why not stick with Rails?**

To be clear: we love [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org). It's been fantastic for rapid development and has scaled well for our needs. For heavier interactive features, we've already been using Elm for frontend apps like Bracket Builder, Scheduling, Scoring, and Results widgets, with PostgREST providing clean APIs on the backend. This functional programming approach has worked beautifully.

But for where we're headed, we need:

* Compile-time safety (Ruby is dynamically typed)
* BEAM-level concurrency (Rails doesn't even come close)
* Shared client/server types (Rails is backend-only)
* Functional patterns built-in (Rails is object-oriented)

This isn't about Rails being bad. It's about choosing the right foundation for what comes next. Ruby on Rails will always have a place in our hearts, but Gleam is the right tool for where we're going.

## SQLite Over PostgreSQL[​](#sqlite-over-postgresql "Direct link to SQLite Over PostgreSQL")

**This one surprised us.**

Curling IO v2 runs on PostgreSQL. We assumed we'd use Postgres for v3. But we're betting on [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) instead.

**Why SQLite?**

* **Isolated databases** - Clean separation of concerns with dedicated database files
* **In-process speed** - Zero network latency between app and database
* **Operational simplicity** - No database server to manage, tune, or cluster
* **Cost savings** - Orders of magnitude cheaper than managed Postgres
* **[Litestream](https://litestream.io) backups** - Continuous replication to offsite storage

**What about scale?**

For the same infrastructure budget as Rails + PostgreSQL, we expect Gleam + SQLite to handle roughly:

* 1,000x more concurrent connections
* 100x the data volume
* 100x the throughput during peak traffic (registrations, live scoring)

These numbers sound outrageous, but they aren't pulled out of thin air. BEAM processes are \~2KB each vs Rails threads at \~1MB - that's where the 1,000x connection multiplier comes from. And eliminating network round-trips to a separate database server (SQLite runs in-process) while leveraging BEAM's lightweight concurrency model accounts for the throughput gains. These are well-documented characteristics of the technology, not optimistic guesses.

That said, we'll be validating everything with extensive benchmarking and real-world load tests as we build.

If SQLite doesn't scale as expected, we'll just stick with PostgreSQL - an equally fantastic database.

## Vertical-First Scaling[​](#vertical-first-scaling "Direct link to Vertical-First Scaling")

Our scaling strategy is simple: start on a single powerful server and scale up from there.

* One server with co-located app + database
* Warm backup server + continuous offsite backups
* Scale up CPU and RAM as we grow
* Horizontal splitting available if we ever need it, but we likely won't

**Why vertical-first?**

* Operational simplicity (one server to deploy, backup, monitor)
* No distributed systems complexity
* SQLite stays fast (in-process, no network)
* Cost-effective
* Defer complexity until actually needed

If we ever outgrow a single server, we have a clean path to splitting things up. But with BEAM's concurrency and SQLite's in-process speed, we expect a single powerful server to handle far more than we'll need for a very long time.

## What's Next[​](#whats-next "Direct link to What's Next")

We'll be building this out over the coming months alongside the existing platform. Curling IO v2 isn't going anywhere - it continues to run and receive updates as usual. When v3 is ready and thoroughly tested, we'll transition everyone over at once - a clean, coordinated switch rather than a drawn-out process. We won't make that switch until we're confident everything is solid.

We'll share more technical details as we go. Next up: a deeper look at how we're approaching the migration from Rails, and early performance benchmarks comparing the two stacks.

# Accounting Codes

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

Curling IO provides two levels of accounting features:

1. **Accounting Codes** (All Plans) - Categorize revenue items with account, class, and project codes that appear in your order items report
2. **Accounting Transactions** (Premium Only) - Comprehensive double-entry bookkeeping with accrual accounting that generates detailed journal entries for every order, payment, and refund

Most clubs use accounting codes for basic revenue categorization. Premium clubs have access to the full accounting transactions system for complete integration with accounting software like QuickBooks, Xero, or Sage.

This document covers **Accounting Codes**, which are available to all clubs. For information about the Premium accounting transactions system, see [Accounting Transactions](/docs/accounting/accounting-transactions.md).

## Enabling or Disabling Accounting Codes[​](#enabling-or-disabling-accounting-codes "Direct link to Enabling or Disabling Accounting Codes")

Accounting codes are enabled by default for Premium clubs, but can be toggled on or off as needed:

**To enable or disable accounting codes:**

1. Go to **Club → Settings**
2. Scroll to the **Accounting** section
3. Check or uncheck the box to enable or disable accounting codes
4. Save

**Note:** Enabling or disabling accounting codes will not affect historical data - any codes already captured on past orders will remain in your reports. The setting only affects future orders.

**For Premium clubs:** If you disable accounting codes, the accounting transactions system will also stop recording new transactions. Existing transactions remain accessible in your reports, but no new transactions will be created until you re-enable accounting codes.

## Accounting Codes (All Plans)[​](#accounting-codes-all-plans "Direct link to Accounting Codes (All Plans)")

Accounting codes allow you to categorize revenue items for reporting. When enabled, you can set default account codes for each type of registration, and optionally add more detailed tracking codes at the item level. These codes appear in your Order Items report and can be exported to CSV.

**Available to:** All clubs

**What you get:**

* Categorize revenue by account, class, and project codes
* Codes captured at time of purchase
* Appears in Order Items report
* CSV export for manual import into accounting software

## When to Use Accounting Codes[​](#when-to-use-accounting-codes "Direct link to When to Use Accounting Codes")

Most clubs either don't need accounting codes at all, or simply set up 8 default codes and never touch individual items. You can add optional sub-categorization at the item level for detailed tracking by demographics, departments, or grant funding.

## The Two-Tier System[​](#the-two-tier-system "Direct link to The Two-Tier System")

### 1. Club-Level Defaults (Simple)[​](#1-club-level-defaults-simple "Direct link to 1. Club-Level Defaults (Simple)")

Set default account codes in [Club Settings](/docs/club-management/settings.md) for each type of registration:

* **Leagues** - Individual league registrations (e.g., 4010)
* **Bonspiels** - Competition/bonspiel registrations (e.g., 4020)
* **Programs** - Programs like Learn to Curl, camps, seminars (e.g., 4030)
* **Products** - Pro shop items and merchandise (e.g., 4040)
* **Fees** - Membership and other fees (e.g., 4050)
* **Venues** - Venue rental revenue (e.g., 4060)
* **Order Adjustments** - Manual adjustments, discounts, and credits applied to orders (e.g., 4900)
* **Convenience Fees** - Processing and service fees charged on orders (e.g., 4070)

These codes will automatically apply to all items of that type unless you override them.

**Tip:** Account codes typically match your chart of accounts in QuickBooks, Sage, or other accounting software. Use the same codes you have in your accounting system for seamless reporting and integration.

### 2. Item-Level Overrides (Advanced)[​](#2-item-level-overrides-advanced "Direct link to 2. Item-Level Overrides (Advanced)")

For more detailed tracking, you can add codes to individual items:

* **Leagues and Competitions** - Track by demographics (MENS, WOMENS, JUNIOR), skill level, or special events
* **Products** - Separate merchandise from rentals, track fundraising campaigns
* **Fees** - Differentiate membership types or age groups
* **Programs** - Track Learn to Curl vs training camps, grant-funded programs

## The Three Code Types[​](#the-three-code-types "Direct link to The Three Code Types")

### Account Code[​](#account-code "Direct link to Account Code")

**Purpose:** Primary revenue or expense category from your chart of accounts

**When to override:**

* Use a special account for charity events
* Separate different product categories (merchandise vs rentals)
* Track different fee types (membership vs capital improvement)

**Examples:** `1000`, `2000`, `3000`, `4000`, `5000`

**Leave blank** to use the club default (recommended for most items)

### Class Code (Optional)[​](#class-code-optional "Direct link to Class Code (Optional)")

Sub-category for tracking by department, demographic, or program type. Typically maps to Class in QuickBooks and Category in Xero.

**Common examples:**

* Demographics: `MENS`, `WOMENS`, `JUNIOR`, `SENIOR`, `MIXED`
* Skill level: `COMPETITIVE`, `RECREATIONAL`, `BEGINNER`, `ADVANCED`
* Program type: `LEARN2CURL`, `TRAINING`, `CAMP`, `VOLUNTEER`
* Product type: `PROSHOP`, `RENTAL`, `MERCHANDISE`, `APPAREL`, `EQUIPMENT`
* Fee type: `ADULT`, `JUNIOR`, `STUDENT`, `AFFILIATE`

### Project Code (Optional)[​](#project-code-optional "Direct link to Project Code (Optional)")

Track specific grants, fundraisers, or special initiatives. Typically maps to Location or Project in QuickBooks and Category in Xero.

**Common examples:**

* Grants: `GRANT_2024`, `YOUTH_DEVELOPMENT`, `ACCESSIBILITY_GRANT`
* Fundraising: `CAPITAL_CAMPAIGN_2024`, `FUNDRAISER_2024`
* Initiatives: `GROW_THE_GAME`, `COACH_TRAINING`, `FACILITY_UPGRADE`

## Understanding Order Items vs Payments[​](#understanding-order-items-vs-payments "Direct link to Understanding Order Items vs Payments")

Accounting codes are assigned to **order items**, not payments. When a member checks out, they typically purchase multiple items in their cart:

* A league registration
* Affiliate fees (provincial and national)
* Membership fees
* Add-ons like lockers
* Additional leagues for their children

A single payment covers all these items, but each item gets its own accounting codes. For example, in one checkout:

* League registration → Account: 1000, Class: MENS
* Provincial Fee → Account: 5000, Class: AFFILIATE
* Membership Fee → Account: 5100
* Locker → Account: 4000, Class: RENTAL

This item-level detail allows you to properly categorize revenue in your accounting software, even though the member only made one payment. Your order item reports will show each item separately with its corresponding codes, making it easy to track revenue by category.

## How Codes Are Captured[​](#how-codes-are-captured "Direct link to How Codes Are Captured")

When a member completes a registration or purchase, Curling IO captures the accounting codes at that moment and stores them with the order item. The codes are captured once and don't change, even if you later modify the item's codes. This ensures historical accuracy in your financial records.

These codes then appear in your order item reports and can be exported for use in your accounting software.

## Common Use Cases[​](#common-use-cases "Direct link to Common Use Cases")

### Basic Club (Most Common)[​](#basic-club-most-common "Direct link to Basic Club (Most Common)")

**Setup:**

* Enable accounting in Club Settings
* Set 8 default account codes
* Never touch individual items

**Result:** All revenue automatically categorized by type with zero ongoing effort

### Intermediate Club - Demographics[​](#intermediate-club---demographics "Direct link to Intermediate Club - Demographics")

**Need:** Track league revenue by gender for board reporting

**Setup:**

* Set club default for leagues (1000)

* Edit each league to add class codes:

  <!-- -->

  * Men's League → Class: `MENS`
  * Women's League → Class: `WOMENS`
  * Mixed League → Class: `MIXED`

**Result:** All leagues use account 1000, but can report separately by gender

### Advanced Club - Grant Tracking[​](#advanced-club---grant-tracking "Direct link to Advanced Club - Grant Tracking")

**Need:** Report on grant-funded youth development program

**Setup:**

* Set club default for programs (3000)

* Edit program:

  <!-- -->

  * Leave account blank (uses default 3000)
  * Set class code: `JUNIOR`
  * Set project code: `GRANT_2024`

**Result:** Easy to filter and report all grant-funded youth program revenue

### Sophisticated Club - Multiple Categories[​](#sophisticated-club---multiple-categories "Direct link to Sophisticated Club - Multiple Categories")

**Need:** Separate merchandise from rentals, track fundraising campaigns

**Setup:**

* Products with different accounts:

  <!-- -->

  * Pro shop items: Account `4100`, Class `MERCHANDISE`
  * Equipment rentals: Account `4200`, Class `RENTAL`
  * Fundraising items: Account `4300`, Project `CAPITAL_CAMPAIGN_2024`

**Result:** Complete separation and tracking across multiple dimensions

## Setting Up Accounting Codes[​](#setting-up-accounting-codes "Direct link to Setting Up Accounting Codes")

### Step 1: Set Default Codes[​](#step-1-set-default-codes "Direct link to Step 1: Set Default Codes")

1. Go to **Club → Settings**

2. Scroll to the **Accounting** section

3. Set default account codes for each type:

   <!-- -->

   * **Leagues** - e.g., 4010
   * **Bonspiels** - e.g., 4020
   * **Programs** - e.g., 4030
   * **Products** - e.g., 4040
   * **Fees** - e.g., 4050
   * **Venues** - e.g., 4060
   * **Order Adjustments** - e.g., 4900
   * **Convenience Fees** - e.g., 4070

4. Use codes that match your accounting software's chart of accounts

5. Save

### Step 2: Add Item-Level Codes (Optional)[​](#step-2-add-item-level-codes-optional "Direct link to Step 2: Add Item-Level Codes (Optional)")

For more detailed tracking, edit individual items:

**Leagues and Competitions:**

1. Edit the league or competition
2. Scroll to the **Accounting Codes** section
3. Add Account Code (override), Class Code, or Project Code as needed
4. Save

**Products, Fees, and Programs:** Follow the same process in each item's edit form.

## Reporting and Exporting[​](#reporting-and-exporting "Direct link to Reporting and Exporting")

### Order Items Report[​](#order-items-report "Direct link to Order Items Report")

All accounting codes appear in your order items report:

1. Go to **Reports → Order Items**
2. Use filters to find specific codes
3. Export to CSV for import into your accounting software

The CSV export includes columns for:

* Account Code
* Class Code
* Project Code

## Best Practices[​](#best-practices "Direct link to Best Practices")

### Keep It Simple[​](#keep-it-simple "Direct link to Keep It Simple")

Start with just the 8 club defaults. Only add item-level codes if you have a specific reporting need.

### Use Consistent Naming[​](#use-consistent-naming "Direct link to Use Consistent Naming")

Establish a standard for class and project codes:

* Use UPPER\_CASE for consistency
* Keep codes short but descriptive
* Document your codes for other administrators

### Examples:[​](#examples "Direct link to Examples:")

* ✅ Good: `MENS`, `WOMENS`, `JUNIOR`, `GRANT_2024`
* ❌ Avoid: `men's`, `Women`, `jr`, `grant`

### Plan Before You Start[​](#plan-before-you-start "Direct link to Plan Before You Start")

Before enabling accounting codes:

1. Review your accounting software's chart of accounts
2. Decide which account codes to use for each type
3. Determine if you need class or project tracking
4. Document your code structure

### Don't Overcomplicate[​](#dont-overcomplicate "Direct link to Don't Overcomplicate")

You can't change codes after purchase, so:

* Start simple and add complexity only when needed
* Most clubs only need account codes, not class/project
* Consider if you'll actually use the granularity before adding it

## Frequently Asked Questions[​](#frequently-asked-questions "Direct link to Frequently Asked Questions")

### Can I change codes after a purchase is made?[​](#can-i-change-codes-after-a-purchase-is-made "Direct link to Can I change codes after a purchase is made?")

No. Codes are captured at the moment of purchase and become part of the historical record. This ensures accuracy in your financial reports. If you need to change how future purchases are categorized, update the codes on the item itself.

**For Premium clubs with accounting transactions enabled:** Any changes to account codes in Club Settings or on individual items will only affect new transactions going forward. Existing accounting transactions are immutable and will never be changed. However, if you have historical transactions with null account codes (from before codes were configured), those can be backfilled with the newly configured codes. This maintains the integrity of your financial audit trail while allowing you to complete your historical data. See [Accounting Transactions](/docs/accounting/accounting-transactions.md) for more details.

### What happens if I don't set any codes?[​](#what-happens-if-i-dont-set-any-codes "Direct link to What happens if I don't set any codes?")

Items will have blank/null accounting codes in reports. This makes it visible which items don't have codes assigned, rather than incorrectly assigning them to a default category.

### Do I need to use all three code types?[​](#do-i-need-to-use-all-three-code-types "Direct link to Do I need to use all three code types?")

No. Most clubs only use account codes. Class and project codes are optional and should only be used if you have specific tracking needs.

### Can I use the same class or project code across different item types?[​](#can-i-use-the-same-class-or-project-code-across-different-item-types "Direct link to Can I use the same class or project code across different item types?")

Yes! For example, you might use `JUNIOR` as a class code for both leagues and fees to track all junior-related revenue across categories.

### What if my accounting software doesn't support class or project tracking?[​](#what-if-my-accounting-software-doesnt-support-class-or-project-tracking "Direct link to What if my accounting software doesn't support class or project tracking?")

Just use account codes. The class and project codes will be in your exports but you can ignore them if your accounting system doesn't use them.

### How do I track codes for inherited fees (provincial/national)?[​](#how-do-i-track-codes-for-inherited-fees-provincialnational "Direct link to How do I track codes for inherited fees (provincial/national)?")

Inherited fees (like provincial and national affiliation fees) automatically use your club's default fee account code. Any codes set on the inherited fee itself are ignored. If you want to categorize inherited fees differently, set a specific fee account code in your Club Settings, and all inherited fees will use that code.

# Accounting Transactions

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

The accounting transactions system provides comprehensive double-entry bookkeeping with accrual accounting principles. Instead of just tagging revenue items with codes, the system automatically generates detailed journal entries (debits and credits) for every financial event in your club.

**What you get:**

* Full double-entry bookkeeping (every transaction has balanced debits and credits)
* Accrual accounting (revenue recognized when order placed, not when paid)
* Automatic journal entries for orders, payments, refunds, and deposits
* Journal entry grouping (related transactions grouped together for easy import)
* Balance sheet tracking (Accounts Receivable, HST Payable, Club Credit Liability, etc.)
* Processing fee expense tracking for payment processor fees (Stripe, SportsPay)
* Club credit accounting (payments, refunds, and manual grants)
* Human-readable account labels (Revenue, A/R, HST, etc.) for easy filtering
* Dedicated Accounting Transactions report with visual grouping
* CSV export optimized for QuickBooks, Xero, and Sage integration
* Sequential payment allocation with partial refund tracking

**Important:** Accounting transactions are only recorded while you have an active Premium subscription and account codes are enabled in Club Settings. If you disable account codes (uncheck them in settings), transaction recording will stop and cannot be backfilled if you re-enable them later.

## Prerequisites[​](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Premium Feature

The accounting transactions system is only available to Premium clubs. All clubs can use basic [Accounting Codes](/docs/accounting/accounting-codes.md), but the full double-entry bookkeeping system with accrual accounting requires a Premium subscription or online payments setup and enabled (which automatically grants Premium).

Before enabling accounting transactions, you should first understand [Accounting Codes](/docs/accounting/accounting-codes.md). The accounting transactions system builds on accounting codes by adding full journal entries and balance sheet tracking.

## Accrual Accounting Principles[​](#accrual-accounting-principles "Direct link to Accrual Accounting Principles")

Traditional cash-basis accounting records revenue when you receive payment. Accrual accounting recognizes revenue when it's earned (when the order is placed), giving you a more accurate picture of your club's financial position.

**Example:**

* Member registers for a $100 league on January 15
* Member pays $50 on January 20
* Member pays remaining $50 on February 10

**Cash-basis accounting** would show:

* January: $50 revenue
* February: $50 revenue

**Accrual accounting** (what Curling IO uses) shows:

* January 15: $100 revenue recognized, $100 Accounts Receivable created
* January 20: $50 cash received, $50 Accounts Receivable reduced
* February 10: $50 cash received, $50 Accounts Receivable reduced

This approach shows you earned $100 in revenue in January, even though you haven't collected it all yet.

## Double-Entry Bookkeeping[​](#double-entry-bookkeeping "Direct link to Double-Entry Bookkeeping")

Every transaction creates balanced journal entries where debits equal credits. This is the foundation of professional accounting and ensures your books always balance.

**Example:** Member purchases a $113 league registration (includes $13 HST)

```
Journal Entry:
DR  Accounts Receivable        $113.00
CR  Revenue (Account 4010)     $100.00
CR  HST Payable                $13.00
```

When they pay:

```
Journal Entry:
DR  Undeposited Funds          $113.00
CR  Accounts Receivable        $113.00
```

## Balance Sheet Account Codes[​](#balance-sheet-account-codes "Direct link to Balance Sheet Account Codes")

In addition to revenue account codes (4000 series), the system uses balance sheet accounts to track assets, liabilities, and expenses:

### Assets[​](#assets "Direct link to Assets")

* **Accounts Receivable (1200)** - Money owed to the club from unpaid or partially-paid orders
* **Undeposited Funds** - Payments received but not yet deposited to bank
* **Cash Account** - Your actual bank account balance

### Liabilities[​](#liabilities "Direct link to Liabilities")

* **HST Payable (2110)** - Sales tax collected that must be remitted to government
* **Club Credit Liability** - Customer deposits/prepayments owed to members as club credits (similar to gift card liability)

### Expenses[​](#expenses "Direct link to Expenses")

* **Processing Fee Expense** - Payment processor fees (Stripe, SportsPay) deducted from deposits
* **Club Credit Expense** - Cost of granting club credits to members (courtesy credits, promotions)

These accounts are configured in **Club → Settings** and cannot be overridden at the item level.

## Tax Handling[​](#tax-handling "Direct link to Tax Handling")

The accounting transactions system automatically tracks all sales taxes (HST, GST, PST) as liabilities that need to be remitted to the government.

### How Tax is Recorded[​](#how-tax-is-recorded "Direct link to How Tax is Recorded")

When an order is placed, taxes are recorded in the **HST Payable** liability account:

```
DR  Accounts Receivable    $113.00
CR  Revenue                $100.00
CR  HST Payable (2110)     $13.00
```

This creates a liability - the club owes $13.00 to the government. When you remit taxes quarterly or annually, your accountant will use this HST Payable balance.

### Multiple Tax Rates[​](#multiple-tax-rates "Direct link to Multiple Tax Rates")

If your club charges multiple tax rates (e.g., GST + PST, or different HST rates for different provinces), all taxes flow into the single HST Payable account. The system tracks the breakdown:

**Example:** $100 item with 5% GST and 7% PST

```
DR  Accounts Receivable    $112.00
CR  Revenue                $100.00
CR  HST Payable            $12.00
```

Your Order Items report shows the tax breakdown per item (tax1\_amount, tax2\_amount), but the accounting transactions combine them into one liability account for simplicity.

### Tax on Refunds[​](#tax-on-refunds "Direct link to Tax on Refunds")

When you refund an item, the tax liability is reduced:

```
DR  Revenue                $100.00
DR  HST Payable            $13.00
CR  Accounts Receivable    $113.00
```

This reduces your HST Payable balance, since you're no longer collecting that tax from the member.

### Tax-Exempt Items[​](#tax-exempt-items "Direct link to Tax-Exempt Items")

Items with no tax (tax-exempt products, services, etc.) simply don't create HST Payable entries:

```
DR  Accounts Receivable    $100.00
CR  Revenue                $100.00
```

The system automatically handles this based on your tax settings for each item.

### Reconciling Tax Payable[​](#reconciling-tax-payable "Direct link to Reconciling Tax Payable")

Your HST Payable account balance represents the total tax you've collected and owe to the government. To reconcile:

1. Export the Accounting Transactions report
2. Filter by Account Code: 2110 (HST Payable)
3. Sum all credits (tax collected) minus all debits (tax refunded)
4. This balance should match your tax filing

**Example balance calculation:**

* Credits (tax collected): $15,600
* Debits (tax refunded): -$780
* **Net HST Payable: $14,820**

This is the amount you owe for the reporting period.

## Transaction Types[​](#transaction-types "Direct link to Transaction Types")

The system creates different types of accounting transactions for different financial events. The following sections detail each transaction type and its journal entries:

1. **Revenue Recognition** - When orders are submitted
2. **Cash Receipts** - When payments are received
3. **Refunds** - When refunds are processed
4. **Order/Item Deletion** - When orders or items are deleted
5. **Deposit Processing** - When payments are deposited to bank
6. **Offline Payments** - When cash/check/e-transfer payments are recorded
7. **Club Credit Payments** - When members pay with club credit
8. **Club Credit Refunds** - When refunds are issued as club credit
9. **Manual Club Credit Grants** - When managers grant courtesy credits

### 1. Revenue Recognition (Order Submitted)[​](#1-revenue-recognition-order-submitted "Direct link to 1. Revenue Recognition (Order Submitted)")

When a member submits an order, revenue is recognized immediately:

```
DR  Accounts Receivable     (Total order amount)
CR  Revenue (by item)       (Item subtotals using your account codes)
CR  HST Payable             (Tax amounts)
```

**Example:** Order with $100 league + $13 HST

| Date       | Type               | Account               | Debit   | Credit  |
| ---------- | ------------------ | --------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| 2025-01-15 | Revenue recognized | 1200 (A/R)            | $113.00 |         |
| 2025-01-15 | Revenue recognized | 4010 (League Revenue) |         | $100.00 |
| 2025-01-15 | HST charged        | 2110 (HST Payable)    |         | $13.00  |

### 2. Cash Receipts (Payment Succeeded)[​](#2-cash-receipts-payment-succeeded "Direct link to 2. Cash Receipts (Payment Succeeded)")

When a payment is received, cash is recorded and Accounts Receivable is reduced:

```
DR  Undeposited Funds       (Payment amount)
CR  Accounts Receivable     (Payment amount)
```

Payments are allocated to order items sequentially (smallest items paid first). This allocation method enables refunding of fully-paid items even when an order is only partially paid, providing flexibility for partial refunds and cancellations.

**Example:** $113 payment received

| Date       | Type              | Account           | Debit   | Credit  |
| ---------- | ----------------- | ----------------- | ------- | ------- |
| 2025-01-20 | Payment initiated | Undeposited Funds | $113.00 |         |
| 2025-01-20 | Payment initiated | 1200 (A/R)        |         | $113.00 |

### 3. Refunds (Full and Partial)[​](#3-refunds-full-and-partial "Direct link to 3. Refunds (Full and Partial)")

**Important:** The system handles refunds intelligently based on whether each item is being fully or partially refunded. A single refund operation can include multiple items, some fully refunded (cancellations) and others partially refunded (price adjustments).

**3a. Full Refund (Cancellation)**

When an item is refunded for its full remaining amount (bringing net amount paid to $0), this is treated as a **cancellation**. The item status changes to `'cancelled'`.

**Journal Entries:**

```
DR  Revenue ([account_code])  (Remaining revenue after previous reductions)
DR  HST Payable               (Remaining tax after previous reductions)
CR  Undeposited Funds         (Cash returned to member)
CR  Accounts Receivable       (Any remaining unpaid balance cleared)
```

**Note on credits:** If the item was fully paid, only Undeposited Funds is credited (cash refund). If the item had an unpaid balance, that balance is credited to A/R to clear the receivable, with the remainder going to Undeposited Funds.

**Key Point:** If there were previous partial refunds on this item, the system only reverses the *remaining* revenue and tax, not the original full amount. This prevents double-reversing revenue that was already reduced in earlier partial refunds.

**3b. Partial Refund (Price Adjustment)**

When an item is refunded for less than its full remaining amount (leaving some net payment remaining), this is treated as a **price adjustment**. The item's price is reduced, but it remains in paid/partially-paid status.

**Journal Entries:**

```
DR  Revenue ([account_code])  (Proportional base amount)
DR  HST Payable               (Proportional tax amount)
CR  Undeposited Funds/A/R     (Refund amount based on payment status)
```

The revenue reduction is proportional to the refund amount relative to the item's total. The item's `amount` field is reduced by the proportional base amount, effectively lowering the price.

**Mixed Refunds:**

When processing a refund with multiple items, each item is handled according to its refund amount:

* Items refunded for their full remaining balance are cancelled
* Items refunded for less than their remaining balance have their price adjusted
* All items are processed in the same refund transaction

### 4. Order/Item Deletion[​](#4-orderitem-deletion "Direct link to 4. Order/Item Deletion")

When a club deletes an order or order item, the system automatically creates reversal transactions to maintain balanced books.

**For submitted but unpaid orders:**

If you delete an order that was submitted but never paid, the system reverses the revenue recognition entries:

```
DR  Revenue (by item)       (Item amounts)
DR  HST Payable             (Tax amounts)
CR  Accounts Receivable     (Total order)
```

This removes the revenue and Accounts Receivable that were created when the order was submitted.

**For paid orders:**

Deleting paid orders or individual items requires processing refunds first. The system prevents deletion of paid items to maintain accurate financial records.

**Why this matters:** This ensures your Accounts Receivable balance stays accurate. If a member cancels before paying, deleting the order removes the receivable without requiring a formal refund process.

### 5. Deposit Processing[​](#5-deposit-processing "Direct link to 5. Deposit Processing")

When online payments (Stripe, SportsPay) are received, they initially go to **Undeposited Funds**. When your payment processor deposits funds to your bank account, you can record the deposit:

**Automatic (Stripe/SportsPay):**

For clubs using Stripe or SportsPay, deposits are automatically recorded when payouts are processed. Payment processors typically deduct processing fees before depositing funds:

**With processing fees:**

```
DR  Cash Account            (Net amount after fees)
DR  Processing Fee Expense  (Processing fees + application fees)
CR  Undeposited Funds       (Gross payment amount)
```

**Example:** $113 payment with $3.58 processing fee + $1.50 application fee

| Date       | Type                   | Account     | Debit   | Credit  |
| ---------- | ---------------------- | ----------- | ------- | ------- |
| 2025-01-25 | Payment deposited      | Cash        | $107.92 |         |
| 2025-01-25 | Processing fee expense | Fee Expense | $5.08   |         |
| 2025-01-25 | Payment deposited      | Undeposited |         | $113.00 |

**Without processing fees:**

```
DR  Cash Account       (Gross payment amount)
CR  Undeposited Funds  (Gross payment amount)
```

The system tracks which payments are included in each payout, maintaining a clear audit trail from payment → undeposited funds → cash account.

**Manual Recording:**

Some clubs manage deposits manually to perform bank reconciliation, matching deposits in the system to their bank statements. This ensures proper cash controls and accurate financial reporting.

### 6. Offline Payments[​](#6-offline-payments "Direct link to 6. Offline Payments")

When a club records an offline payment (cash, check, e-transfer recorded manually), the accounting treatment is the same as online payments:

```
DR  Undeposited Funds    (Payment amount)
CR  Accounts Receivable  (Payment amount)
```

However, offline payments go directly to your **Cash Account** if you mark them as "Already Deposited" when recording them:

```
DR  Cash Account         (Payment amount)
CR  Accounts Receivable  (Payment amount)
```

This provides flexibility for clubs that receive cash/checks and deposit them immediately, versus clubs that batch deposits weekly or monthly.

### 7. Club Credit Payments[​](#7-club-credit-payments "Direct link to 7. Club Credit Payments")

When a member uses club credit (store credit) to pay for an order, the accounting treatment differs from cash payments because it involves a liability reduction instead of cash:

```
DR  Club Credit Liability  (Payment amount)
CR  Accounts Receivable    (Payment amount)
```

**Example:** $50 club credit applied to order

| Date       | Type                | Account               | Debit  | Credit |
| ---------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| 2025-01-15 | Club credit applied | Club Credit Liability | $50.00 |        |
| 2025-01-15 | Club credit applied | A/R                   |        | $50.00 |

**Key differences from cash payments:**

* **Reduces liability** - Applying credit reduces what the club owes to the member
* **No deposit** - Club credit payments never have a deposit date since no actual cash is involved
* **Sequential allocation** - Like cash payments, club credit allocates to order items sequentially (smallest first)

### 8. Club Credit Refunds[​](#8-club-credit-refunds "Direct link to 8. Club Credit Refunds")

When a refund is issued as club credit instead of cash, the accounting treatment creates or increases a liability to the member. Like cash refunds, the system distinguishes between full refunds (cancellations) and partial refunds (price adjustments).

**Journal Entries:**

```
DR  Revenue ([account_code])  (Refunded amount - proportional for partial refunds)
DR  HST Payable               (Refunded tax - proportional for partial refunds)
CR  Club Credit Liability     (Total refund)
```

Note that unlike cash refunds, there is **no cash withdrawal entry** because the club retains the funds. The refund increases the club's liability to the member (club credit balance).

**Example:** Refund $22.60 to club credit ($20 + $2.60 HST)

| Date       | Type             | Account               | Debit  | Credit |
| ---------- | ---------------- | --------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| 2025-02-01 | Refund initiated | Revenue (4030)        | $20.00 |        |
| 2025-02-01 | Refund initiated | HST Payable (2110)    | $2.60  |        |
| 2025-02-01 | Refund initiated | Club Credit Liability |        | $22.60 |

**Key differences from cash refunds:**

* **Increases liability** - Refunding to credit increases what club owes to member
* **No withdrawal** - Club credit refunds don't reduce your bank balance
* **Member retains value** - Credit can be used on future purchases

### 9. Manual Club Credit Grants[​](#9-manual-club-credit-grants "Direct link to 9. Manual Club Credit Grants")

When a club manager manually grants club credit to a member (courtesy credit, compensation, promotions), the system records both an expense and a liability:

```
DR  Club Credit Expense    (Grant amount)
CR  Club Credit Liability  (Grant amount)
```

**Example:** Manager grants $25 courtesy credit to member

| Date       | Type                | Account               | Debit  | Credit |
| ---------- | ------------------- | --------------------- | ------ | ------ |
| 2025-02-15 | Club credit granted | Club Credit Expense   | $25.00 |        |
| 2025-02-15 | Club credit granted | Club Credit Liability |        | $25.00 |

**Key points:**

* **Expense recognition** - Records the cost of giving away credit
* **Liability tracking** - Increases club's debt to members
* **Separate from refunds** - Manual grants are recorded separately from refund-generated credits

## The Accounting Transactions Report[​](#the-accounting-transactions-report "Direct link to The Accounting Transactions Report")

Premium clubs have access to a dedicated **Accounting Transactions** report under **Reports → Accounting Transactions**.

### Understanding Journal Entry Grouping[​](#understanding-journal-entry-grouping "Direct link to Understanding Journal Entry Grouping")

The report visually groups related transactions together that represent a single financial event (like submitting an order or receiving a payment). Each group includes all the debits and credits that balance to $0 for that event.

**Visual grouping:** The Order ID, Transaction Type, and Date appear only on the first row of each group, making it easy to see which transactions belong together. Subsequent transactions in the same group have these columns blank, creating a clear visual hierarchy.

**Example:** When a member submits an order for $113 (including HST), the report shows:

| Order ID | Type               | Date       | Item   | Account | Label   | Debit   | Credit  |
| -------- | ------------------ | ---------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 12345    | Revenue recognized | 2025-01-15 | League | 1200    | A/R     | $113.00 |         |
|          |                    |            | League | 4010    | Revenue |         | $100.00 |
|          |                    |            | League | 2110    | HST     |         | $13.00  |

This grouping makes it clear that all three accounting entries are part of the same journal entry and should balance together (debits = credits).

The report shows:

* **Order ID** - Reference to the order (clickable to filter) - shown once per group
* **Type** - Revenue recognized, Payment initiated, Refund processed, etc. - shown once per group
* **Date** - Transaction date - shown once per group
* **Item Type** - Type of item (League, Product, Fee, etc.)
* **Description** - Item description
* **Class Code** - Sub-categorization
* **Project Code** - Grant/project tracking
* **Account Code** - The account affected
* **Label** - Human-readable account type (Revenue, A/R, HST, Cash, Processing Fees, etc.)
* **Debit** - Debit amount (if applicable)
* **Credit** - Credit amount (if applicable)

### Understanding Account Labels[​](#understanding-account-labels "Direct link to Understanding Account Labels")

The **Label** column provides human-readable names for account types, making it easier to filter and understand transactions without needing to memorize account codes.

**Account Label Examples:**

| Account Type       | Label                                                   | Account Codes                                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Revenue accounts   | `Revenue`                                               | 4010 (Leagues), 4020 (Programs), 4030 (Products), 4040 (Fees) |
| Asset accounts     | `A/R`, `Cash`, `Undeposited Funds`                      | 1200 (Accounts Receivable), club-specific codes               |
| Liability accounts | `HST`, `PST`, `GST`, `Sales Tax`, `Club Credit Payable` | 2110 (HST Payable), club-specific codes                       |
| Expense accounts   | `Processing Fees`, `Club Credit Given`                  | Club-specific codes                                           |

**Tax Labels:** Tax labels are automatically determined based on your club's location:

* **Ontario clubs:** `HST` (Harmonized Sales Tax)
* **BC clubs:** `GST` and `PST` (separate federal/provincial taxes)
* **US clubs:** `Sales Tax` and `State` (varies by state)
* **Other locations:** Falls back to `Tax 1` and `Tax 2` if no match found

**Why Labels Matter:**

Labels let you filter transactions without knowing specific account codes. For example:

* Want to see all revenue? Filter by Label: `Revenue` (includes all revenue accounts regardless of code)
* Need all tax transactions? Filter by Label: `HST`, `GST`, or `PST` depending on your location
* Looking for cash movements? Filter by Labels: `Cash`, `Undeposited Funds`, `A/R`

**Understanding the Columns:**

Each transaction shows three pieces of information to help you track and categorize:

* **Item Type** - What was sold (League, Product, Fee, Program)
* **Account Code** - Matches your chart of accounts (4010, 1200, 2110)
* **Account Label** - Easy-to-read category (Revenue, A/R, HST)

This lets you filter reports either by specific account codes or by broad categories.

### Filters[​](#filters "Direct link to Filters")

Filter transactions by:

* **Date Range** - From/To dates

* **Order ID** - See all transactions for a specific order

* **Transaction Type:**

  * **All** - Show all transactions
  * **Revenue Recognition** - Order items submitted (revenue and tax entries)
  * **Cash Receipts** - Payments received (cash and club credit applications)
  * **Deposits** - Payments moved to bank (including processing fees)
  * **Refunds** - Money returned to members (cash and club credit refunds)
  * **Club Credit** - Club credit activity (payments, refunds, manual grants)
  * **Processing Fees** - Payment processor fee expenses
  * **Reversals** - All reversal transactions (from deletions)

### Summary Totals[​](#summary-totals "Direct link to Summary Totals")

The report displays:

* **Count** - Total number of transactions
* **Total Debits** - Sum of all debit entries
* **Total Credits** - Sum of all credit entries
* **Balance** - Should always be $0 (debits = credits)

### Export Formats[​](#export-formats "Direct link to Export Formats")

Premium clubs can export accounting transactions in multiple formats optimized for different accounting software:

#### CSV Export (General Purpose)[​](#csv-export-general-purpose "Direct link to CSV Export (General Purpose)")

Export to CSV in standard double-entry format for import into:

* QuickBooks Online
* Xero
* Excel
* Other accounting software

The CSV export includes additional columns not shown in the on-screen report, specifically designed for accounting software integration.

**CSV Columns (in order):**

1. **Journal Entry Group** - Unique identifier grouping related transactions (e.g., `123-RevenueRecognized`)
2. **Order ID** - Reference to the order
3. **Transaction Type** - Type of accounting event
4. **Date/Time** - Transaction timestamp
5. **Item Type** - What was sold (League, Product, Fee, etc.)
6. **Description** - Item description
7. **Class** - Sub-categorization code
8. **Project** - Project/grant tracking code
9. **Account** - Account code from your chart of accounts
10. **Label** - Human-readable account type (Revenue, A/R, HST, etc.)
11. **Debit** - Debit amount (if applicable)
12. **Credit** - Credit amount (if applicable)

**Journal Entry Grouping:**

The **Journal Entry Group** column (first column) groups related transactions that represent a single financial event. This makes it easy to import complete journal entries into QuickBooks or other accounting software.

The group ID uses an abbreviated format: a 3-letter transaction code followed by the source ID number.

**Examples:**

* `REV12345` - Revenue recognized from order item 12345
* `PMT67890` - Payment 67890 initiated
* `DEP67890` - Payment 67890 deposited to bank
* `RFI55555` - Refund 55555 initiated

All transactions with the same Journal Entry Group ID should balance to $0 (total debits = total credits).

**Example CSV Output:**

```
Journal Entry Group,Order ID,Type,Date,Item,Description,Class,Project,Account,Label,Debit,Credit
REV123,100,Revenue recognized,2025-01-15 10:23:45,League,Monday Night League,,MENS,1200,A/R,113.00,

## Sequential Payment Allocation & Partial Refunds[​](#sequential-payment-allocation--partial-refunds "Direct link to Sequential Payment Allocation & Partial Refunds")

When a payment is received for an order with multiple items, the system allocates payment sequentially to the smallest items first. This enables accurate partial refund tracking.

**Example:** Order with three items totaling $140.60

* Fee: $5.00
* Product: $22.60
* League: $113.00

**Payment of $70 is allocated:**

1. Fee: $5.00 paid in full (100%)
2. Product: $22.60 paid in full (100%)
3. League: $42.40 paid (37.5% paid, 62.5% unpaid)

This means you can refund the fee or product in full, even though the order is only partially paid. The system tracks which payments have been applied to each item, showing the refundable amount (net amount paid) for each item.

### Refunding Partially Paid Orders[​](#refunding-partially-paid-orders "Direct link to Refunding Partially Paid Orders")

The sequential allocation system makes partial refunds straightforward:

**Example 1: Full Refund of Fully-Paid Item**

An order has three items where $70 has been paid (fee $5 + product $22.60 + league $113). Staff decides to refund the product in full.

**Refund form:**

* Staff checks the "Locker" item
* Refund amount shows $22.60 (the full refundable amount)
* Staff processes the refund

**What happens:**

* Product item status changes to `'cancelled'`
* Member receives $22.60 refund
* Fee and league remain active

**Accounting entries:**

```
DR  Revenue (Product)     $20.00
DR  HST Payable           $2.60
CR  Undeposited Funds     $22.60
```

**Result:** Member receives $22.60 refund, product is cancelled.

**Example 2: Partial Refund (Price Adjustment)**

A league registration was paid in full for $113. Staff decides to issue a $20 discount (member missed a session).

**Refund form:**

* Staff checks the "League" item
* Staff changes the refund amount from $113.00 to $20.00
* Staff processes the refund

**What happens:**

* Item price is reduced from $113 to $93
* Item remains in `'paid'` status (not cancelled)
* Member receives $20 refund

**Accounting entries:**

```
DR  Revenue                $17.70    (proportional to $20 refund)
DR  HST Payable            $2.30     (proportional tax)
CR  Undeposited Funds      $20.00
```

**Result:** Member receives $20 refund, item price adjusted to $93, still marked as paid.

**Example 3: Mixed Refund (Multiple Items)**

An order has three items all fully paid:

* League: $113 (refundable)
* Curling Canada Fee: $5 (refundable)
* Locker: $22.60 (refundable)

**Refund form:**

* Staff checks "Curling Canada Fee" - leaves amount at $5.00 (full refund)
* Staff checks "Locker" - changes amount from $22.60 to $10.00 (partial refund)
* Staff leaves "League" unchecked (no refund)
* Staff processes the refund

**What happens:**

* Fee item: Status changes to `'cancelled'`
* Locker item: Price reduced from $22.60 to $12.60, remains `'paid'`
* League item: Unaffected
* Member receives total refund of $15

**Accounting entries for the combined refund:**

```
DR  Revenue (Fee)            $5.00
DR  Revenue (Locker)         $8.85     (proportional to $10 refund)
DR  HST Payable (Locker)     $1.15     (proportional tax)
CR  Undeposited Funds        $15.00
```

**Result:** One refund transaction handles both a cancellation and a price adjustment.

**Important Note for Event Registrations:** Partial refunds do not remove a participant's registration from an event (league, bonspiel, program). Only a full refund that cancels the item will unregister the participant. This allows clubs to offer discounts or adjustments while keeping participants enrolled.

### Refundable Amounts in the UI[​](#refundable-amounts-in-the-ui "Direct link to Refundable Amounts in the UI")

When viewing an order, each item displays:

* **Amount Paid** - How much has been paid toward this specific item
* **Net Amount Paid** - Amount paid minus any previous refunds or price reductions
* **Refundable Amount** - The amount available to refund (equal to net amount paid)

Items that haven't been paid yet show as "Not refundable" and are disabled in the refund form. You can only refund what's been paid.

**Important:** The refundable amount automatically accounts for any previous partial refunds. If an item had a $20 partial refund processed previously, the refundable amount is reduced accordingly.

## Setting Up Accounting Transactions[​](#setting-up-accounting-transactions "Direct link to Setting Up Accounting Transactions")

### Step 1: Upgrade to Premium[​](#step-1-upgrade-to-premium "Direct link to Step 1: Upgrade to Premium")

Accounting transactions require an active Premium subscription. Go to **Club → Premium** to upgrade.

### Step 2: Configure Account Codes[​](#step-2-configure-account-codes "Direct link to Step 2: Configure Account Codes")

1. Go to **Club → Settings**

2. Scroll to **Accounting**

3. Configure all account codes:

   <!-- -->

   * Revenue codes (Leagues, Bonspiels, Programs, Products, Fees, Venues, Order Adjustments, Convenience Fees)
   * Asset codes (Accounts Receivable, Undeposited Funds, Cash Account)
   * Liability codes (HST Payable, Club Credit Liability)
   * Expense codes (Processing Fee Expense, Club Credit Expense)

4. Save

### Step 3: Start Recording Transactions[​](#step-3-start-recording-transactions "Direct link to Step 3: Start Recording Transactions")

Once configured, the system automatically creates accounting transactions for:

* New orders submitted (revenue recognition)
* New payments received (cash receipts and club credit applications)
* New refunds processed (cash refunds and club credit refunds)
* Payment deposits with processing fee tracking
* Manual club credit grants

### Important Limitations[​](#important-limitations "Direct link to Important Limitations")

* **Account Codes Required** - Transactions are only recorded when account codes are enabled in Club Settings. If you disable account codes, transaction recording stops and cannot be backfilled if you re-enable them later.
* **Premium Required** - If your Premium subscription lapses, no new transactions will be recorded (but existing transactions remain accessible).
* **Immutable Records** - Once recorded, accounting transactions never change. If you modify account codes, only future transactions are affected.

## Best Practices for Accounting Transactions[​](#best-practices-for-accounting-transactions "Direct link to Best Practices for Accounting Transactions")

### Plan Your Account Structure[​](#plan-your-account-structure "Direct link to Plan Your Account Structure")

Plan your account code structure completely before configuring codes. While you can change codes later, existing transactions won't be updated.

### Review Transaction Types[​](#review-transaction-types "Direct link to Review Transaction Types")

Understand when each transaction type is created:

* **Revenue Recognition** - As soon as order is submitted (even if unpaid)
* **Cash Receipts** - Only when payment successfully processes
* **Refunds** - When refund is issued

### Reconciliation Procedures[​](#reconciliation-procedures "Direct link to Reconciliation Procedures")

Regular reconciliation ensures your books accurately reflect your club's financial position. Follow these procedures monthly (or more frequently during busy periods):

#### 1. Reconcile Undeposited Funds to Bank Deposits[​](#1-reconcile-undeposited-funds-to-bank-deposits "Direct link to 1. Reconcile Undeposited Funds to Bank Deposits")

**Purpose:** Verify all payments received have been properly deposited to your bank account.

**Procedure:**

1. Export Accounting Transactions report

2. Filter by Account Label: `Undeposited Funds`

3. Calculate the Undeposited Funds balance:

   <!-- -->

   * Sum all debits (payments received)
   * Subtract all credits (payments deposited or refunded)
   * Result = Outstanding payments not yet deposited

4. Compare to your actual undeposited payments (e.g., cash/checks on hand)

5. Investigate any discrepancies

**Common timing differences:**

* Online payments processed but not yet paid out by Stripe/SportsPay (typically 2-7 business days)
* Cash/checks received but not yet deposited to bank
* Refunds processed but not yet withdrawn from bank account

#### 2. Reconcile Accounts Receivable[​](#2-reconcile-accounts-receivable "Direct link to 2. Reconcile Accounts Receivable")

**Purpose:** Verify outstanding member balances are accurate and collectible.

**Procedure:**

1. Export Accounting Transactions report

2. Filter by Account Code: 1200 (A/R)

3. Calculate A/R balance:

   <!-- -->

   * Sum all debits (orders placed, unpaid balances)
   * Subtract all credits (payments received, refunds for unpaid items)
   * Result = Total outstanding member balances

4. Cross-reference to Orders report filtered by status: `submitted`, `partially_paid`

5. Review aging of receivables:

   <!-- -->

   * Current (0-30 days)
   * 31-60 days
   * 61-90 days
   * Over 90 days (may require collection action)

**Red flags:**

* A/R balance doesn't match outstanding orders report
* Large balances over 90 days old
* Negative A/R balance (indicates overpayment or accounting error)

#### 3. Reconcile Tax Payable (HST/GST/PST)[​](#3-reconcile-tax-payable-hstgstpst "Direct link to 3. Reconcile Tax Payable (HST/GST/PST)")

**Purpose:** Ensure tax liability is accurately calculated for remittance to government.

**Procedure:**

1. Export Accounting Transactions report for your tax reporting period

2. Filter by Account Code: 2110 (HST Payable)

3. Calculate tax liability:

   <!-- -->

   * Sum all credits (tax collected on sales)
   * Subtract all debits (tax refunded)
   * Result = Net tax owed to government

4. This amount should match your tax filing for the period

5. When you remit tax to government, create a manual journal entry:
   <!-- -->
   ```
   DR  HST Payable     (Amount remitted)
   CR  Cash Account    (Amount remitted)
   ```

**Important:** The system does NOT automatically record tax remittances. You must manually record these payments to clear the HST Payable liability.

#### 4. Reconcile Club Credit Liability[​](#4-reconcile-club-credit-liability "Direct link to 4. Reconcile Club Credit Liability")

**Purpose:** Track total outstanding club credit obligations to members.

**Procedure:**

1. Export Accounting Transactions report

2. Filter by Account Label: `Club Credit Payable`

3. Calculate club credit liability:

   <!-- -->

   * Sum all credits (credits granted or refunded to credit)
   * Subtract all debits (credits applied to orders)
   * Result = Total club credits outstanding

4. Cross-reference to Club Credits report (if available) or member balances

5. Review for:

   <!-- -->

   * Stale credits (over 12 months unused)
   * Unusually large credits or frequent grants that may need review

#### 5. Verify Processing Fee Expenses[​](#5-verify-processing-fee-expenses "Direct link to 5. Verify Processing Fee Expenses")

**Purpose:** Ensure payment processor fees are accurately recorded.

**Procedure:**

1. Export Accounting Transactions report for the month

2. Filter by Account Label: `Processing Fees`

3. Sum all processing fee debits

4. Compare to:

   <!-- -->

   * Stripe/SportsPay monthly statements
   * Bank deposit reconciliation (net deposits + fees should equal gross payments)

5. Investigate any discrepancies

**Common issues:**

* Fees from previous month included in current month payout
* Application fees vs. processing fees split incorrectly
* Manual deposits recorded without fee tracking

### Monthly Reconcile Checklist[​](#monthly-reconcile-checklist "Direct link to Monthly Reconcile Checklist")

Use this checklist to ensure complete monthly reconciliation:

* <!-- -->
  Undeposited Funds balance reconciles to actual undeposited items
* <!-- -->
  Accounts Receivable balance matches outstanding orders
* <!-- -->
  Accounts Receivable aging reviewed, collection actions documented
* <!-- -->
  Tax Payable balance calculated and documented
* <!-- -->
  Tax remittances recorded (if applicable for period)
* <!-- -->
  Club Credit Liability balance verified
* <!-- -->
  Processing Fee Expense reconciled to processor statements
* <!-- -->
  All journal entry groups balance (debits = credits)
* <!-- -->
  Bank reconciliation completed (Cash Account)
* <!-- -->
  Unusual or large transactions reviewed and documented

### Export Frequently[​](#export-frequently "Direct link to Export Frequently")

Export transactions to CSV regularly for import into your accounting software. The sequential nature of the report makes it easy to export only new transactions since your last import.

### Monitor Accounts Receivable[​](#monitor-accounts-receivable "Direct link to Monitor Accounts Receivable")

The A/R balance represents money owed to your club from unpaid orders. Monitor this balance to:

* Follow up on outstanding payments
* Identify members with unpaid balances
* Reconcile against your bank deposits

### Monitor Club Credit Liability[​](#monitor-club-credit-liability "Direct link to Monitor Club Credit Liability")

If your club uses club credits (store credit), the Club Credit Liability balance represents money your club owes to members. Monitor this balance to:

* Track total outstanding credit obligations
* Budget for potential redemptions
* Reconcile credit grants, applications, and refunds
* Identify unusual patterns in credit usage

## Frequently Asked Questions[​](#frequently-asked-questions "Direct link to Frequently Asked Questions")

### Can I change account codes after enabling accounting transactions?[​](#can-i-change-account-codes-after-enabling-accounting-transactions "Direct link to Can I change account codes after enabling accounting transactions?")

Yes, but only future transactions will use the new codes. Existing accounting transactions are immutable and will never be changed. However, if you have historical transactions with null account codes (from before codes were configured), those can be backfilled with the newly configured codes. This maintains the integrity of your financial audit trail while allowing you to complete your historical data.

### What happens if my Premium subscription lapses?[​](#what-happens-if-my-premium-subscription-lapses "Direct link to What happens if my Premium subscription lapses?")

No new accounting transactions will be recorded while your subscription is lapsed. However, all existing transactions remain accessible in your reports. When you renew Premium, transaction recording will resume from that date forward.

### Can I delete orders that have accounting transactions?[​](#can-i-delete-orders-that-have-accounting-transactions "Direct link to Can I delete orders that have accounting transactions?")

You can delete unpaid orders - the system will automatically create reversal transactions to maintain balanced books. Paid orders require refunding before deletion to ensure accurate financial records.

### How do I reconcile my Accounts Receivable balance?[​](#how-do-i-reconcile-my-accounts-receivable-balance "Direct link to How do I reconcile my Accounts Receivable balance?")

Export the Accounting Transactions report and filter by Account Code 1200 (A/R). Sum all debits (money owed to you) minus all credits (payments received). This balance should match your outstanding orders.

### What if I made a mistake in an order?[​](#what-if-i-made-a-mistake-in-an-order "Direct link to What if I made a mistake in an order?")

Accounting transactions are immutable - you can't edit them. Instead:

* For unpaid orders: Delete the order (creates reversals) and create a new correct order
* For paid orders: Process a refund, then create a new order if needed
* This approach maintains a complete audit trail of all changes

### What's the difference between a full refund and a partial refund?[​](#whats-the-difference-between-a-full-refund-and-a-partial-refund "Direct link to What's the difference between a full refund and a partial refund?")

The system handles these two scenarios differently:

**Full Refund (Cancellation):** When you refund all payments made on an item, the item status changes to `'cancelled'` and all remaining revenue is reversed. This is treated as cancelling the service/product.

**Partial Refund (Price Adjustment):** When you refund less than the full amount paid, the item's price is reduced proportionally and the item remains in paid/partially-paid status. This is treated as a price discount or adjustment, not a cancellation.

**Example:** If a member paid $113 for a league and you refund $20, the league price drops to $93 (not cancelled). If you later refund the remaining $93, then it becomes a cancellation.

This distinction ensures your revenue accounts accurately reflect what services were actually provided versus cancelled.

### Can I use this with QuickBooks/Xero/Sage?[​](#can-i-use-this-with-quickbooksxerosage "Direct link to Can I use this with QuickBooks/Xero/Sage?")

Yes! Curling IO provides multiple export formats optimized for different accounting software:

**QuickBooks Desktop:** Use the dedicated **QuickBooks Desktop Export** to download an `.iif` file that imports directly into QuickBooks Desktop. This is the fastest and easiest option for QuickBooks Desktop users - no manual mapping required.

**Sage 50:** Use the dedicated **Sage 50 Export** to download a `.txt` file formatted specifically for Sage 50 imports. This format is compatible with all Sage 50 versions and regions.

**QuickBooks Online / Xero / Other software:** Use the **CSV Export** for general-purpose imports. The CSV format includes:

* **Journal Entry Group ID** - First column groups related debits/credits together
* **Standard double-entry format** - Separate Debit and Credit columns
* **Complete transaction data** - All fields included in every row
* **Chronological order** - Oldest transactions first (standard for imports)
* **Balanced entries** - Each group balances to $0 (debits = credits)

All export formats are designed for easy import and follow accounting best practices. See the [Export Formats](#export-formats) section above for detailed instructions on using each format.

### Do I need to understand accounting to use this feature?[​](#do-i-need-to-understand-accounting-to-use-this-feature "Direct link to Do I need to understand accounting to use this feature?")

Basic understanding helps, but the system handles the complex accounting automatically. Your accountant can work with the exported CSV files even if you're not familiar with journal entries and double-entry bookkeeping.

### How are payment processing fees tracked?[​](#how-are-payment-processing-fees-tracked "Direct link to How are payment processing fees tracked?")

When deposits are recorded from Stripe or SportsPay, the system automatically tracks processing fees as expenses. The deposit journal entry shows:

* Debit to Cash Account (net amount received)
* Debit to Processing Fee Expense (fees deducted)
* Credit to Undeposited Funds (gross payment amount)

This ensures your expense tracking accurately reflects the cost of accepting online payments.

### How does club credit accounting work?[​](#how-does-club-credit-accounting-work "Direct link to How does club credit accounting work?")

Club credits create a liability (money the club owes to members). The accounting tracks:

* **Manual grants** - Debit Club Credit Expense, Credit Club Credit Liability
* **Credit payments** - Debit Club Credit Liability, Credit A/R (reduces liability as credit is used)
* **Credit refunds** - Debit Revenue/HST, Credit Club Credit Liability (increases liability when refunding to credit)

The Club Credit Liability balance shows your total obligation to members.

### How do I record tax remittances to the government?[​](#how-do-i-record-tax-remittances-to-the-government "Direct link to How do I record tax remittances to the government?")

The system does NOT automatically record tax payments to the government. When you remit HST/GST/PST:

1. Calculate your tax liability from the Accounting Transactions report (filter by Account 2110)
2. Pay the amount to the government via your normal process
3. **Manually record the payment** in your accounting software:
   <!-- -->
   ```
   DR  HST Payable (2110)    (Amount remitted)
   CR  Cash Account          (Amount remitted)
   ```

This clears the liability from your books. Without this entry, your HST Payable balance will continue to grow even after you've paid the government.

**Important:** Most clubs will make this journal entry in their primary accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero, etc.) rather than in Curling IO, as tax remittances are typically handled outside the club management system.

### Members[​](#members "Direct link to Members")

This report tracks member information for curlers who have registered for items requiring a curler profile during the current season.

**How members are created**: Member records are automatically created from curler profiles when:

1. A curler completes registration for an event, league, program, product, or fee that requires a curler profile (orders that are submitted or paid)
2. A scheduled background process runs (typically nightly) that syncs curler data into member records
3. Once created, member records persist even if the order is later cancelled, refunded, or deleted

**Filtering options**:

* **Season**: Select which season's members to view
* **Keyword search**: Search by name, email, postal code, city, province, or club name

**Download**: Click the **Download** button to export member data as a CSV file with all fields included.

**Note**: Members are deduplicated automatically - if a curler registers for multiple items in the same season, only one member record is created for that club and season combination. However, the member count may be slightly inflated due to:

* **Duplicate profiles**: If curlers create duplicate profiles and register with both, duplicate member records will appear in the report. These duplicates should be apparent when reviewing the report data (identical or very similar names, dates of birth, etc.).
* **Cancelled/refunded orders**: Members remain in the report even if their orders are later cancelled or refunded, as long as the order items existed when the nightly background process ran.

### Spares[​](#spares "Direct link to Spares")

These are the curlers that have opted to spare for one of more events.

### Order Items[​](#order-items "Direct link to Order Items")

This is an unfiltered list of all order items (leagues, products, competitions, and fees).

Custom fields are not included in this report's download unless you have [explcitly included them.](/docs/club-management/custom-fields.md#select-relevant-reports)

### Payouts[​](#payouts "Direct link to Payouts")

This is a list of all bank payouts (direct deposits) you've received from our payment processor. To see a chart showing payouts by date, click the **Payouts by date** link in the description.

This report only shows up once you're set up with our online payment processor.

# Augmenting Curler Profiles

Sometimes you may want to ask your curler's for some additional information, but only once per season (or lifetime).

\*\* NOTE: This method of capturing additional information should be used sparingly or it will clutter up your reports.

We're going to walk through a contrived example. Let's say we want to ask each curler what inspired them to take up curling. We also only ever want to ask our curler's this question once, the very first time they register at the club.

First we'll need to create a custom field to capture the information.

1. Create a new custom field to ask our question.
2. Name it "Inspiration" and give it a descriptive hint.
3. Check the box next to the "Products report" so that we'll be able to see this field in that report.

![Inspiration Custom Field](/assets/images/custom-field-700970abc9183e5e359ebd70c51df1fe.png)

Next we'll want to create an addon product (or fee) to hold this custom field.

1. Create a new product called "Additional Info".
2. Make sure the Product type is "Add-on".
3. Check the boxes for "Requires a curler profile" and "Lifetime per curler" (if it's a question you want to ask once per season, check that box instead).
4. Leave the price at $0.00.
5. Add our "Inspiration" custom field and make it required.

![Inspiration Addon Product](/assets/images/product-6aaa229ab6d83df70bb87cfa72b74243.png)

Next, we want to add our addon as a required custom field to each of our leagues (or products that require a profile).

1. Edit each league.
2. Add the "Additional Info" addon to each league, making it required.

![Inspiration Added to League](/assets/images/league-334b1fb889d3757cdcdc178f5627c0cb.png)

Now the first time a curler registers at your club they will be asked what inspired them to take up curling. For this example they will only ever be asked once since we made this a lifetime product.

![Inspiration Cart](/assets/images/cart-4e92f9612ea1bf3c6c6ffb203868cfa2.png)

Later, when you download your products reports, it will have a column for "Inspiration" along with the other curler information.

At any time you can click the "Purchased" link next to your "Additional Info" product to download this information.

# CurlingSchedules.com

The Curling Draw Schedule Builder creates balanced draws, tracks fairness, and lets you fine-tune every game with drag-and-drop editing. Use this guide to understand how each control works and how the interface responds while you plan events.

[Generate a Schedule](https://curlingschedules.com/)

tip

The same schedule builder is embedded in Curling IO's [Draw Schedule Templates](/docs/event-management/draw-schedule-templates.md) feature. You can create schedules on CurlingSchedules.com and import them into Curling IO, or create them directly within Curling IO. The main difference is that schedules created on CurlingSchedules.com are saved to your browser's local storage, while templates in Curling IO are saved to your club's database.

note

A tutorial video will live here. For now, use the walkthrough below to explore every control.

## Top Controls[​](#top-controls "Direct link to Top Controls")

The controls above the schedule grid set the size of the draw and regenerate the layout.

### Teams dropdown[​](#teams-dropdown "Direct link to Teams dropdown")

Choose how many teams participate (2–48). Adjustments preview immediately and commit on blur or when you stop dragging the slider in mobile browsers. Changing the team count queues a fresh baseline so the optimizer can rebuild the schedule with the new roster.

### Sheets dropdown[​](#sheets-dropdown "Direct link to Sheets dropdown")

Pick the number of active playing surfaces (1–16). When you lower the count, excluded sheets disappear from the grid; when you raise it, new empty columns are added. The optimizer only uses the sheets that remain visible.

### Optimize / Reset button[​](#optimize--reset-button "Direct link to Optimize / Reset button")

Run the optimizer to improve fairness without disturbing manual assignments. If the most optimal layout for your settings already exists, the optimizer button is disabled.

### Shuffle button[​](#shuffle-button "Direct link to Shuffle button")

Randomize the teams across your schedule while maintaining the existing fairness metrics. Use it to explore alternative matchups while keeping the same team and sheet counts.

## Fairness Metrics Bar[​](#fairness-metrics-bar "Direct link to Fairness Metrics Bar")

A line beginning with “Repeats per team” summarizes fairness metrics for the current schedule. “Repeats per team” reports the maximum number of times any team appears, “consecutive” counts unwanted back-to-back appearances, and “total” counts excess games beyond the perfect round robin. Lower values indicate a more balanced draw.

## Schedule Grid[​](#schedule-grid "Direct link to Schedule Grid")

The central table represents the full draw with one row per draw and one column per sheet. Cells contain draggable games and respond to sheet exclusions and conflicts.

### Column headers[​](#column-headers "Direct link to Column headers")

Each header displays the sheet label and a toggle icon. Click the icon to exclude or re-enable a sheet. Excluded sheets turn gray, strike through their labels, and are ignored by the optimizer until re-enabled.

### Table cells[​](#table-cells "Direct link to Table cells")

Cells show each matchup as a draggable game. Drag a game to another cell to move it, or drag it to another game to swap the two assignments. Cells highlight in yellow when they are valid swap targets, red when a placement introduces a conflict, and soft red when a conflict is persistent.

### Bye column[​](#bye-column "Direct link to Bye column")

When there is an odd number of teams, the final column shows “BYE” slots to guarantee each team rests once. These slots cannot receive games and help you verify that byes rotate evenly.

### Drag-and-drop tips[​](#drag-and-drop-tips "Direct link to Drag-and-drop tips")

* Drag a game to another cell to move it; drop on an occupied cell to swap.
* Yellow outlines mark valid swap targets; red outlines signal conflicts that will create duplicate teams in a draw.
* Dropping onto the queue removes the assignment while keeping the game ready to re-place.
* The optimizer respects manual placements; regenerate when you want a fresh baseline.

## Sidebar[​](#sidebar "Direct link to Sidebar")

The sidebar provides quick actions for managing schedules, adjusting preferences, and staging games.

### Schedules[​](#schedules "Direct link to Schedules")

The Schedules panel lists the active working copy, previously saved layouts, and a New schedule template. Each saved entry exposes actions so you can manage draws without leaving the sidebar.

* **Load / Reload**: Load swaps the working grid to the selected schedule. Reload restores the last-saved state of the active entry, discarding any unsaved edits.
* **Export CSV**: Export the chosen schedule as a CSV with draws, sheets, and matchup pairings—either from the active grid or directly from the saved copy.
* **Share**: Open the Share modal with a base64 share code plus metadata. Use Copy code to place it on the clipboard or Download to save the encoded text for teammates.
* **Copy**: Duplicate the saved layout into a new entry so you can tweak variations without overwriting the original.
* **Delete**: Remove the saved schedule after confirmation. The active working copy remains untouched until you load another entry.
* **New schedule**: Create a fresh baseline using the default team and sheet counts—handy when starting a brand-new event.
* **Import code**: Launch the Import modal. Paste a shared code, validate it, and then load or overwrite the current schedule once conflicts are resolved.

### Settings[​](#settings "Direct link to Settings")

Rename the schedule, adjust the singular/plural venue labels, choose numeric or alphabetic sheet sequencing, toggle the draw-packing behavior (“Fill unused sheets with the next round”), and expand the Team names list for up to 48 custom entries. Select Apply to commit pending changes; Cancel closes the panel without saving.

### Save schedule[​](#save-schedule "Direct link to Save schedule")

Collect a schedule title, highlight conflicts or validation warnings, and offer Save with an optional Overwrite action when a name already exists. Use it to store snapshots as you refine the draw.

### Game queue[​](#game-queue "Direct link to Game queue")

Park games temporarily in the drop zone labeled “Drag games here to unassign them.” Games in the queue remain draggable back into any open cell, and the zone shares the conflict-highlighting rules so you can spot issues before reassigning.

***

Updated for Draw Schedule Builder v1.0.0.

# Event Details

Events are leagues and competitions.

## Fetching the event[​](#fetching-the-event "Direct link to Fetching the event")

```
https://api-curlingio.global.ssl.fastly.net/en/clubs/[subdomain]/events/[id]
```

Replacing **\[subdomain]** with your clubs Curling IO subdomain, and **\[id]** with the events (league or competition) unique identifier. For example Curling Canada's Curling IO site is at <https://canada.curling.io>, and the 2023 Time Hortons Brier ID is 14890. Therefore we replace **\[subdomain]** with **canada** and **\[id]** with **14890** giving us:

```
https://api-curlingio.global.ssl.fastly.net/en/clubs/canada/events/14890
```

Replacing **en** with **fr** will fetch the french version.

Note: If you don't know the event ID, you can find it within the [Curling IO admin area](https://curling.io/docs/club-management/leagues), or by using the [Items API to get a list of events along with their IDs](/docs/api/items.md).

## Payload[​](#payload "Direct link to Payload")

```
{
  "id": 14890,
  "name": "2023 Tim Hortons Brier",

  "shot_by_shot_enabled": true,
  "last_stone_draw_enabled": false,
  "draws": []
}
```

### Teams[​](#teams "Direct link to Teams")

Within the teams array node (`"teams": []`) you have team data. These team IDs will be referenced in standings and game\_positions.

Path: teams -> team

```
{
  "id": 47029,
  "name": "Alberta (Koe)",
  "short_name": "AB (KOE)",
  "affiliation": "The Glencoe Club",
  "location": "Calgary, Alberta",
  "lineup": []
}
```

#### Lineup[​](#lineup "Direct link to Lineup")

Within the lineup array node (`"lineup": []`) you have curler data. The curler IDs will be referenced in shots.

Path: teams -> team -> lineup

```
{
  "curler_id": 1781,
  "position": "fourth",
  "skip": true,
  "name": "Kevin Koe",
  "delivery": "Right",
  "club_name": "Glencoe Club",
  "club_city": "Calgary"
}
```

### Stages[​](#stages "Direct link to Stages")

Within the stages array node (`"stages": []`) you have round robin and bracket data.

Path: stages -> stage

```
{
  "id": 6736,
  "type": "RoundRobin",
  "name": "Pool A",
  "standings": [],
  "games": []
}
```

#### Standings[​](#standings "Direct link to Standings")

Within the standings array node (`"standings": []`) you have team standings / rank data.

Path: stages -> stage -> standings -> standing

```
{
  "id": 47187,
  "rank": 1,
  "played": 8,
  "wins": 8,
  "ties": 0,
  "losses": 0
},
```

#### Games[​](#games "Direct link to Games")

Path: stages -> stage -> games -> game

```
{
  "name": "WC2 (CAR) vs NU (HIG)",
  "state": "complete",
  "id": "fd1bc71e",
  "game_positions": []
}
```

##### Game Positions[​](#game-positions "Direct link to Game Positions")

Within the game\_positions array node (`"game_positions": []`) you have game position (side) data, which includes end scores. Evey game should have exactly two game positions, one for each team participating. It's possible to have a game position without a team assigned yet for bracket games, where it's populated by the winner / loser from another game that hasn't finished yet. The end scores are indexed, so the first end score of 2 in the below example is in the first end, followed by 1 in the second end, 0 in the third, etc.

Path: stages -> stage -> games -> game -> game\_positions -> game\_position

```
{
  "team_id": 47037,
  "score": 8,
  "result": "won",
  "top_rock": true,
  "first_hammer": true,
  "time_remaining": "606",
  "end_scores": [2, 1, 0, 0, 3, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0],
  "shots": []
}
```

###### Shots[​](#shots "Direct link to Shots")

Within the shots array node (`"shots": []`) you have shot by shot data. Most events don't track shot by shot data. The end number references the indexes from the end scores, starting at 1 (not 0).

Path: stages -> stage -> games -> game -> game\_positions -> game\_position -> shots -> shot

```
{
  "turn": "I",
  "throw": "E",
  "rating": "4",
  "curler_id": 56162,
  "end_number": 1,
  "shot_number": 1
}
```

### Draws[​](#draws "Direct link to Draws")

Within the draws array node (`"draws": []`) you have draw schedule data. The draw sheets list the game IDs for each sheet in order. In this example, the game ID of "3db7fda0" is on Sheet 1. Often sheets will be null when there is no game on that sheet for the draw.

The epoch field is a timestamp in seconds and can be used to sort / order draws if needed. Draws should be in the correct order already (oldest -> newest).

Path: draws -> draw

```
{
  "id": 127575,
  "label": "1",
  "epoch": 1739577600,
  "starts_at": "Mar 03 at  7:00 pm",
  "attendance": 3910,
  "draw_sheets": ["3db7fda0", "cc34ae70", "5f1d2e2b", "0da23f90"]
}
```

# Items

Leagues, competitions, and products can be accessed through the items API via different end points.

## Fetching the list of leagues[​](#fetching-the-list-of-leagues "Direct link to Fetching the list of leagues")

```
https://api-curlingio.global.ssl.fastly.net/en/clubs/[subdomain]/leagues
```

Replacing \[subdomain] with your clubs subdomain. For example Curling Canada's Curling IO site is at <https://canada.curling.io>, therefore their subdomain is "canada", so their leagues API URL would be:

```
https://api-curlingio.global.ssl.fastly.net/en/clubs/canada/leagues
```

## Fetching the list of competitions[​](#fetching-the-list-of-competitions "Direct link to Fetching the list of competitions")

```
https://api-curlingio.global.ssl.fastly.net/en/clubs/[subdomain]/competitions
```

Replacing \[subdomain] with your clubs subdomain. For example Curling Canada's Curling IO site is at <https://canada.curling.io>, therefore their subdomain is "canada", so their competitions API URL would be:

```
https://api-curlingio.global.ssl.fastly.net/en/clubs/canada/competitions
```

## Fetching the list of products[​](#fetching-the-list-of-products "Direct link to Fetching the list of products")

```
https://api-curlingio.global.ssl.fastly.net/en/clubs/[subdomain]/products
```

Replacing \[subdomain] with your clubs subdomain. For example Curling Canada's Curling IO site is at <https://canada.curling.io>, therefore their subdomain is "canada", so their products API URL would be:

```
https://api-curlingio.global.ssl.fastly.net/en/clubs/canada/products
```

## Filtering results[​](#filtering-results "Direct link to Filtering results")

### By Season[​](#by-season "Direct link to By Season")

You can filter by season using `occurred=[delta]` where delta is the number of years previous to the current. So for the current season you would pass `occurred=0` and for last season you would pass -1, so `occurred=-1`, etc.

For example, if I wanted to fetch Curling Canada competitions from last year I would use:

```
https://api-curlingio.global.ssl.fastly.net/en/clubs/canada/competitions?occurred=-1
```

### Only show events that have published results[​](#only-show-events-that-have-published-results "Direct link to Only show events that have published results")

You can filter out events that aren't set to be published yet by passing `registrations=f`. This just tells the API you are looking for event results instead of the event registration list.

For example, this is the end point to use if you want to fetch Curling Canada competition statistics:

```
https://api-curlingio.global.ssl.fastly.net/en/clubs/canada/competitions?registrations=f
```

## Payload[​](#payload "Direct link to Payload")

There are two nodes at the root. One which lists all of the available seasons (varies club by club), and another which lists all of the available items (leagues, competitions, or products).

```
{
  "seasons": [...],
  "items": [...]
}
```

### Seasons[​](#seasons "Direct link to Seasons")

The `seasons` node contains an arraw of available seasons for the club.

```
{
  "display": "2024 / 2025",
  "delta": 0
},
{
  "display": "2023 / 2024",
  "delta": -1
}
```

# Product Details

## Fetching the product[​](#fetching-the-product "Direct link to Fetching the product")

```
https://api-curlingio.global.ssl.fastly.net/en/clubs/[subdomain]/products/[id]
```

Replacing **\[subdomain]** with your clubs Curling IO subdomain, and **\[id]** with the products unique identifier. For example Curling Canada's Curling IO site is at <https://canada.curling.io>, and the Ice techs, Statisticians, Umpires Registry ID is 2916. Therefore we replace **\[subdomain]** with **canada** and **\[id]** with **2916** giving us:

```
https://api-curlingio.global.ssl.fastly.net/en/clubs/canada/products/2916
```

Replacing **en** with **fr** will fetch the french version.

## Payload[​](#payload "Direct link to Payload")

```

# Calendar

**[Venue / Ice Booking is Premium Only](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

The calendar system allows you, the curling club manager, to display your draw schedules, schedule custom events, and allow members to book rentals. This comprehensive scheduling tool supports multiple venues including ice sheets and other club facilities.

You can access the calendar by going to the public side of your club's website and selecting the "Schedules" section from the top navigation. You can enable or disable the calendar in [Club Settings](/docs/club-management/settings.md#navigation-and-layout).

## Calendar Views[​](#calendar-views "Direct link to Calendar Views")

The calendar provides four different views to help you manage your schedule. You can toggle the display of games, bookings, and reservations to focus only on what you want to see.

Administrators have an "Admin View" toggle in the bottom right of the screen they can use to create test bookings and see what their members see.

### Day View[​](#day-view "Direct link to Day View")

Shows time intervals as rows with venues as columns, perfect for detailed scheduling of a single day. This view is ideal for managing ice sheet allocations and venue conflicts.

![Calendar Customization](/img/docs/club-management/calendar/calendar-customization.png)

Use the clock icon to configure your calendar settings, the plus icon to add new venues, and click on existing venues to edit their settings.

### Week View[​](#week-view "Direct link to Week View")

Displays time intervals as rows with days of the week as columns, giving you a broader perspective on weekly scheduling patterns.

### Month View[​](#month-view "Direct link to Month View")

Shows days as cells with weeks as rows and days of the week as columns (Sunday through Saturday), providing a high-level overview of your monthly schedule.

### List View[​](#list-view "Direct link to List View")

Displays all events in a chronological list format, making it easy to see upcoming events, search for specific bookings, and get a quick overview of all scheduled activities.

## Event Types[​](#event-types "Direct link to Event Types")

The calendar displays and manages three types of events:

### Games[​](#games "Direct link to Games")

Read-only events that display your draw schedules imported from league and tournament management. These help prevent conflicts when scheduling other events.

### Rental Bookings[​](#rental-bookings "Direct link to Rental Bookings")

Rental bookings made by club members for practice time or private events. These require:

* Premium subscription activation
* Venue configured as bookable
* Appropriate pricing setup

### Reservations[​](#reservations "Direct link to Reservations")

Administrative blocks for maintenance, closures, meetings, and bookable slots.

Reservations can be one-time or recurring, and include:

* **Bookable slot**: Premium option that creates a targeted reservation members can purchase with its own price and duration; these override booking windows when they overlap.
* **Closure**: Blocks rental bookings entirely for the selected period.
* **Standard reservation**: Reserves time for internal events or maintenance without making it bookable.

## Venue Management[​](#venue-management "Direct link to Venue Management")

![Edit Venue](/img/docs/club-management/calendar/edit-venue.png)

As an administrator, you can manage your club's venues including ice sheets, lounges, and other facilities. Each venue can be configured with:

* **Venue Type**: Specify whether it's an ice sheet or other facility. If the venue type is set to "Sheet" then the system will automatically map it to the club's draw schedules based on its position, and show any games scheduled on that sheet.
* **Publish**: The publish checkbox determines if the venue should be shown to the public
* **Bookable**: The bookable checkbox will allow the venue to be booked
* **Notification Email**: Useful if there's someone, like an ice technician, that needs to be informed when a new booking is made. Administrators will see all new bookings in the Orders section and shouldn't enter their own email here. This is meant for staff who do not have admin access but still need to be notified.
* **Requires Curler**: The requires curler checkbox will require and associate a curler with any bookings for the venue. By requiring a curler profile you are also requiring them to accept your waiver if you are using the Curling IO waivers feature.
* **Tax Configuration**: Configure applicable taxes for bookings
* **Pricing Structure**: Set hourly rates for rentals

### Booking Windows[​](#booking-windows "Direct link to Booking Windows")

![Booking Windows](/img/docs/club-management/calendar/booking-windows.png)

Booking windows are an optional way to configure rental availability that you can use instead of, or alongside, recurring bookable slots. Configure booking windows to control when bookings can be made. This helps manage demand and ensures appropriate advance notice for facility preparation. Booking windows have the following fields:

* **Start Time**: When the booking window opens. If empty, defaults to the start of the club's daily operating hours.
* **End Time**: When the booking window closes. If empty, defaults to the end of the club's daily operating hours.
* **Duration**: Controls how long any bookings in the window last
* **Price**: The cost for this booking window

#### When to use booking windows[​](#when-to-use-booking-windows "Direct link to When to use booking windows")

Booking windows are ideal when you want broad availability without managing a long list of named programs. Clubs that simply open ice for rentals during specific hours, or that need to adjust availability for holidays or bonspiels, can do everything with booking windows alone. You can always add bookable slots when you have a special case that has an explicit name, price, and duration.

### Bookable Slots[​](#bookable-slots "Direct link to Bookable Slots")

![Bookable Slots](/img/docs/club-management/calendar/bookable-slot.png)

Bookable slots let you define specific one-time or recurring reservations members can book with their own duration and price. These targeted openings take precedence over any overlapping booking windows, giving you finer control when you want to promote something like a daily "Practice Ice" slot from 2:00 to 3:00 PM. Bookable slots automatically inherit the venue's notification email, requires-curler requirement, taxes, and any custom fields so that important workflows stay consistent. These can stand alone for clubs with structured offerings, or complement existing booking windows when you want special availability to override the general schedule.

#### When to use bookable slots[​](#when-to-use-bookable-slots "Direct link to When to use bookable slots")

Bookable slots shine when you offer defined programs or experiences—think practice ice or premium lounge rentals. Use them for recurring rentals that have a specific name and price point like Practice Ice. You can also layer them on top of booking windows when a special program should replace the usual availability.

## Booking Cart[​](#booking-cart "Direct link to Booking Cart")

![Booking Cart](/img/docs/club-management/calendar/booking-cart.png)

When booking is enabled, multiple time slots can be added to the cart and completed as a single check out just like any other purchases.

## Calendar Settings[​](#calendar-settings "Direct link to Calendar Settings")

![Calendar Settings](/img/docs/club-management/calendar/settings.png)

Configure your calendar's core functionality:

* **Default View**: Choose which view (Day, Week, Month, List) loads by default when users access the calendar
* **Time Intervals**: Choose from 15 minute to 2 hour increments (default: 1 hour)
* **Daily Schedule**: Set your operating hours start and end times for each day
* **Min advance booking (days)**: Minimum number of days in advance that bookings can be made. If set to "0" (same day), the system still requires at least a 1 hour advance booking time.
* **Max advance booking (days)**: Maximum number of days in advance that bookings can be made

## Creating Reservations[​](#creating-reservations "Direct link to Creating Reservations")

![New Reservation](/img/docs/club-management/calendar/new-reservation.png)

Administrators can create reservations to block time for maintenance, meetings, or special events:

1. **Select Time and Venue**: Choose the date, time, and venue for your reservation
2. **Reservation Type**: Select closure, bookable slot (premium custom price/duration), or a standard reservation for internal events
3. **Recurring Options**: Set up repeating reservations for regular maintenance schedules
4. **Details**: Add descriptions and notes for internal reference

## Key Features[​](#key-features "Direct link to Key Features")

* **Drag-and-Drop Scheduling**: Easily move and reschedule events (admin only)
* **Multi-Venue Support**: Manage ice sheets, lounges, and other club facilities
* **Conflict Detection**: Automatic prevention of double-bookings
* **Mobile Responsive**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

# Club Credits

Club credits allow your users to pay for your leagues, competitions, products, and fees using credit they've accrued.

You can grant credit directly to a specific email address, or by selecting club credit when granting a refund for a payment in an order.

Credits are applied automatically against the total amount of the user's next purchase.

All changes to a user's credit balance are logged and can be exported in the reports section.

**IMPORTANT: Credits are applied to the *account*. This is the email address they login with. Credits are not applied to profiles. In order to redeem credit the member must login with the email address you assigned the credit to. When issueing refunds via credit, the credit is assigned to the email address that owns the order you refunded. *[See the "What is an Account?" section in our FAQ.](/docs/getting-started/faq.md#what-is-an-account)***

## Walkthrough Video[​](#walkthrough-video "Direct link to Walkthrough Video")

The following video will take you, the curling club manager, through the basics of utilizing club credits. If you're new to Curling IO, it's worthwhile to watch this before wading through the rest of our documentation.

## Directly Granting Credits to a User[​](#directly-granting-credits-to-a-user "Direct link to Directly Granting Credits to a User")

As a club manager you can grant credits to any user as long as you know the email address they use to login with.

Within your admin area, click on the **Club** dropdown menu in the top bar and then click on **Club credits**.

This will refund the amount specified and credit the user with that amount which they can then use in a future purchase.

If you later delete this refund, the user's club credits that were granted for the refund will be debited from their club credit balance. If however they don't have enough club credits to cover the amount being debited, you'll first need to correct that, by deleting a credit payment or manually granting them more credits, before the refund can be deleted.

When they submit the order, a club credit payment will be created and their credit balance will be debited.

If they don't have enough credits to cover the cart's total, the club credit payment is still created for the partial amount and the remainder can be paid through other means (online or offline). If they pay the remainder via an online card payment, then there will be two payments created against the order, one for the club credits, and one for the remaining card payment.

## Deleting Club Credits[​](#deleting-club-credits "Direct link to Deleting Club Credits")

You can only delete club credits if there are no outstanding payments or refunds attached to it. If you can't resolve that by deleting the refund / payments attached to the club credit, you can simply decrease the user's club credits to $0.00 by granting a negative credit to them.

## Downloading Club Credits[​](#downloading-club-credits "Direct link to Downloading Club Credits")

You can download a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file of your club credits by clicking the Download button. This report can be imported into Excel or other spreadsheets or databases and will show the balance for each user that has ever had credits.

You can also access a more detailed Club Credit Log report in the **Reports** section which shows the history of all club credit adjustments ever made.

## Finding Profiles[​](#finding-profiles "Direct link to Finding Profiles")

You can access the list of all the profiles who have registered at your club, regardless of season, by clicking on **Profiles** in the top navigation.

## Duplicate Profiles[​](#duplicate-profiles "Direct link to Duplicate Profiles")

Occasionally you will end up with duplicate profiles. This can and will happen for various reasons. Usually it's because someone registered again at a later date but logged in with a different email address than last time that also wasn't entered on the profile. If you spot one of these duplicates, you can **mark** one of them as a duplicate and eventually it'll get merged. **Please make sure the first name, last name, and date of birth are identical between the two profiles.**

## Login as a Curler[​](#login-as-a-curler "Direct link to Login as a Curler")

You are able to login as one of the curlers at your club in order to help them complete their registration if they're struggling to do it themselves.

Just click the "Login as" link below the account's email / name.

Note: This only works with profiles for accounts that have already logged into the system. If instead you need to perform the registration for a profile that has never created an account, you can simply add your email address to the profile, and then you will see and be able to register with that profile from your own account.

## What did a Profile Purchase?[​](#what-did-a-profile-purchase "Direct link to What did a Profile Purchase?")

Next to each profile there is a **Purchased** link. This will take you to the order item reports filtered by the profile. It's a convenient way to see what purchases a profile is associated with.

## Transferring Profile Ownership[​](#transferring-profile-ownership "Direct link to Transferring Profile Ownership")

Occasionally you may need to transfer ownership of a profile to a different account (email address).

This can happen when a profile was created using a club staff account during an in person registration night, but the curler themselves later create their own account.

In order to transfer ownership to another email address, that email address must first have logged in at least once (to create an account within Curling IO).

1. Go to the "Profiles" screen.
2. Click on the name of the profile you wish to transfer.
3. Click the "Transfer ownership" button at the bottom of this screen.
4. Enter the email address you wish to transfer ownership to.

## Importing Profiles[​](#importing-profiles "Direct link to Importing Profiles")

If this is your club's first season using Curling IO then you can import profiles from a previous season that do not yet have a profile in the system by uploading a CSV file.

We don't recommend this in general since it's not difficult for your members to register themselves, and your members will only see the profiles you imported for them if they login using one of the email addresses in the profile. That being said, it can be convenient to initialize your members profiles and potentially make it easier for them to register by pre filling their information.

CSV files can be exported from any spreadsheet or database program, usually by selecting the "File" menu and selected "Export as" or "Download as" and then selecting "CSV".

[Click this link to see an example of a profile spreadsheet.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-smgG2v8atZySX68hwoP-gaDJGvD0sGl3_GHZ7XTrtk/edit?usp=sharing) Only the columns in red are required. The other columns are optional and may be ignored or removed from your import. You must make sure your column names are identical to this example spreadsheet's column names.

### Required Fields[​](#required-fields "Direct link to Required Fields")

* First Name
* Last Name
* Date Of Birth
* Email
* Phone
* Street Address
* City
* Province
* Country
* Postal Code (or Zip Code)
* Emergency Contact Name
* Emergency Contact Phone

These required fields (columns) are highlited in red in the example spreadsheet linked to above.

### Formatting[​](#formatting "Direct link to Formatting")

* The format for date fields is YYYY-MM-DD. For example; January 25th, 1980 would be formatted as "1980-01-25".
* The gender options are "male", "female", and "unspecified".
* Phone numbers should always include the area code and may optionally include the country code (1 for Canada and US). E.g. 1-416-123-1234
* Province should be a 2 letter abbreviation (for US clubs, you can enter the 2 letter state abbreviation here, but keep the column named Province). E.g. "ON"
* Country should be a 2 letter abbreviation. E.g. "CA" for Canada and "US" for United States.
* Twitter handles do not need to include the @ symbol.
* Zip code can be entered into the Postal Code column for US based clubs.

It's probably easiest to just look at the values in the provided example spreadsheet, if you're not sure on the format or requirement of a field.

### Running the Import[​](#running-the-import "Direct link to Running the Import")

Once you have a CSV to import, upload it by clicking the "Choose File" button and selecting it. Then click the "Import" button to run the import. We'll try to detect and ignore any duplicate profiles.

We keep a log you can review for every import in case there are errors due to missing fields or duplicate profiles.

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

* [What is an Account?](/docs/getting-started/faq.md#what-is-an-account)
* [Can our members register family members?](/docs/getting-started/faq.md#can-our-curlers-register-family-members)
* [One of our members paid seasonal fees more than once](/docs/getting-started/faq.md#one-of-our-members-paid-seasonal-fees-more-than-once)

# Custom Fields

Custom fields allow you, the curling club manager, to ask any question you like during registration or purchase of one of your leagues, competitions, or products.

If for example, you'd like to know the name of a team's coach during registration for one of your bonspiels, or whether it's a curler's first time curling at your club, you can create custom fields for these questions. You can even have a custom field for a coupon code and then tie a discount to it.

After creating a custom field you still need to choose which leagues, competitions, and products you want to associate it with, since we won't assume it should be asked for all of your leagues, competitions, and products.

## Finding Custom Fields[​](#finding-custom-fields "Direct link to Finding Custom Fields")

Within your admin area, click on the **Club** dropdown menu in the top bar and then click on **Custom Fields**.

## The Basics[​](#the-basics "Direct link to The Basics")

### The Type of Custom Field[​](#the-type-of-custom-field "Direct link to The Type of Custom Field")

You can use different types of custom fields:

#### Text Box[​](#text-box "Direct link to Text Box")

The most common field type. This is a short free form text box.

For example, *Contact Name* or *Contact Phone*.

#### Text Area[​](#text-area "Direct link to Text Area")

This is a larger free form multiline text box.

For example, *Comments* or *Notes*.

#### Dropdown[​](#dropdown "Direct link to Dropdown")

This is a dropdown field restricting a members choice to just the values you provide. Note that when selecting **Dropdown**, a **Possible Values** option will appear where you need to enter the values to populate the dropdown with.

For example, *Number of Players on the Team: Three, Four, Five, Six* or *First Time Curler?: Yes, No*.

#### Check Box[​](#check-box "Direct link to Check Box")

This is a check box useful for yes or no questions.

**Important:** when associating a checkbox custom field to a league, competition, or product, if you make it required, then everyone will need to check it off.

#### Date[​](#date "Direct link to Date")

This will prompt members to enter a date using a series of dropdowns.

For example, *Date of Certification*.

#### Attachment[​](#attachment "Direct link to Attachment")

This will prompt members to upload an attachment.

**Caution:** Executables and documents could contain a virus, and you are responsible for scanning your own attachments after downloading them.

### Naming your Custom Field[​](#naming-your-custom-field "Direct link to Naming your Custom Field")

This is the name that will be displayed to your members when they are asked to fill it in during registration.

### Hint[​](#hint "Direct link to Hint")

This is a brief description that will be displayed below your custom field when members are asked to fill it in. You can include any instructions here if necessary.

### Select Relevant Reports[​](#select-relevant-reports "Direct link to Select Relevant Reports")

By default none of the downloaded reports will include your custom field. You'll need to check the box next to the reports that should include it.

For example, if you are adding a "Contact Name" custom that will be asked during competition registrations, then you'll most likely want to check the "Competition report" box so that it shows up in that report's downloaded data.

[More information on reports can be found here.](/docs/accounting/reports.md)

# Discounts

You can create discounts to reduce the cost of your leagues, competitions, and products when curler's match criteria that you specify.

For example, you can give curlers a 20% discount on their second league, then 50% off on their third league, or a Junior discount to curlers under the age of 18.

There is a ton of flexibility with discounts, but keep in mind that having an excessive number of discounts, can easily make it very hard to verify who should be receiving one.

## Walkthrough Video[​](#walkthrough-video "Direct link to Walkthrough Video")

The following video will take you, the curling club manager, through the basics of setting up your discounts. If you're new to Curling IO, it's worthwhile to watch this before wading through the rest of our documentation.

## Finding your Discounts[​](#finding-your-discounts "Direct link to Finding your Discounts")

Within your admin area, click on the **Club** dropdown menu in the top bar and then click on **Discounts**.

## The Basics[​](#the-basics "Direct link to The Basics")

### Naming your Discount[​](#naming-your-discount "Direct link to Naming your Discount")

This is the name that will be displayed to your members when they see potential discounts during registration and also when a discount is applied.

Discounts can and should be reused between seasons, so there's no need to include a year or season in the name unless you specifically do not want to reuse it next year.

### Percent or Fixed Amount[​](#percent-or-fixed-amount "Direct link to Percent or Fixed Amount")

You can choose to make your discount a percentage of the amount of the items being discounted (league, product, or competition), or you can make it a fixed amount. Usually percentage based discounts are easier to manage, for example if you were running a multiple league discount, but your league had different prices.

You can't specify both percent and fixed amount.

### Seasonal per Curler[​](#seasonal-per-curler "Direct link to Seasonal per Curler")

You can restrict the discount so that it can't be applied more than once per curler per season.

For example, you may want a *"First Time Curler"* that can only be received the first time the curler purchases a league this season, and not to be applied again if they purchase a second league.

### Active[​](#active "Direct link to Active")

If you need to disable a discount temporarily you can uncheck the **Active** box. When a discount is disabled it cannot be added to leagues, competitions, or products, and will not be applied to your members for anything it is already associated to.

## Criteria[​](#criteria "Direct link to Criteria")

You can (and usually would) specify one or more criteria that the curler must meet in order for the discount to be applied.

This allows you to have different discounts apply to your leagues depending on the age and / or number of items being purchased for the curler, etc. For example you can have a junior discount based on age, or a discount that is only applied if 2 or more items (leagues, programs, fees, or products) are being purchased within the same season for the same curler.

Criteria are cumulative, so if both min AND max ages are specified then both of these conditions must be met by the curler for the discount to be applied.

### Min and Max Age[​](#min-and-max-age "Direct link to Min and Max Age")

These are fairly self-explanatory. If you wanted to apply a junior's discount to curlers 17 and under then you would enter 17 into the Max age field. Keep in mind that age criteria is inclusive in that it's including the age specified. Age criteria uses your club's [age calculation configuration](/docs/club-management/settings.md#age-cutoff). By default, ages are calculated as of the day before your season starts (e.g., June 30th if your season starts July 1st). So if a curler is 18 based on your club's age calculation date, they wouldn't receive a 17 and under discount.

### Number of Items[​](#number-of-items "Direct link to Number of Items")

This allows you to discount the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th + item that a curler purchases during the current season.

Items can be any combination of leagues, programs, fees, or products that you've assigned to the discount. This gives you great flexibility to create discounts like "Get 20% off the 2nd item" or "Get 50% off the 3rd league."

You can even have *stepping* discounts, where for example the 2nd item is 20% off, the 3rd item is 50% off, and the 4th or higher items are 100% off (making them free).

**How the discount is applied:**

When a curler qualifies for the discount, only the Nth item receives the discount (based on your discount configuration):

* For **percentage discounts**, the discount applies to cheaper items first. Items are sorted by price (most expensive to least expensive), and the discount is given to the Nth item in that order. This maximizes savings for your curlers.
* For **fixed amount discounts**, the discount applies to items in the order they were purchased (oldest to newest).

**Example:** If you offer a "Get 20% off the 2nd item" discount and a curler purchases a $150 league and a $100 league in the same cart, the $100 league (the cheaper one, which is 2nd when sorted by price) would receive the 20% discount.

**Important:** If your items have different prices and a curler purchases a cheaper item first, then purchases a more expensive item later, they will miss out on the discount at the time of purchase. For example, if you offer a "Get 20% off the 2nd item" discount with a $100 league and a $200 league, the curler would need to either purchase both at the same time, or purchase the $200 league first to receive the discount on their second purchase. The system will not automatically apply a retroactive discount to the cheaper item.

**Retroactive discount alerts:**

To help identify these situations, the system will alert you on your dashboard when curlers purchase items separately and miss out on potential discounts. You can then review these cases and choose to issue refunds or make price adjustments manually as appropriate.

The following video will take you, the curling club manager, on a deep dive into setting up multi-item discounts.

### Team Position[​](#team-position "Direct link to Team Position")

You can discount curlers based on their selected position. This only works with leagues and competitions which are requiring a curler profile and also asking for their position (optional or required).

A common use for this would be to discount an *"Alternate"* for a team. For example, if you are moving from team based pricing to individual sign up, you might divide the price by 4 and grant alternates a 100% discount. So what may have cost $800 per team registration may now cost $200 per individual, but free for alternates.

The following video discusses different ways to migrate from team based to individual registrations using discounts like team position.

### Matching a Custom Field Value[​](#matching-a-custom-field-value "Direct link to Matching a Custom Field Value")

This is an extremely flexible discount. It allows you to check if the value entered into one of the club's own custom fields matches what the curler entered or selected.

A common use for this would be a *"First Time Curler"* discount. You would have a custom field defined, asking your curlers if this is their first time curling with a dropdown to choose "Yes", or "No". Then you can apply a discount based on them selecting "Yes" for this custom field.

Another example would be a coupon code. You could have a free text custom field asking for a coupon code, and if it matches the value you specify here they get a discount.

### Fee[​](#fee "Direct link to Fee")

Allows you to give a discount to curlers who have already paid, or are about to pay a fee. For example, to offer a discount to members on non-member leagues or products.

### Product[​](#product "Direct link to Product")

Allows you to give a discount to curlers who have already paid, or are about to pay for a product. For example you can offer an Unlimited Leagues addon product in your leagues and discount their price by 100% if selected.

### Exclusive of Other Discount[​](#exclusive-of-other-discount "Direct link to Exclusive of Other Discount")

Prevent a curler from receiving the discount if they are already receiving the discount selected here. You don't want to exclude from both discounts however. The higher discount is typically the one you would select here.

### Exclusive of All Other Discounts[​](#exclusive-of-all-other-discounts "Direct link to Exclusive of All Other Discounts")

If the curler is receiving any other discount for the item being discounted, they won't receive this one. If all discounts they are receiving are exclusive, then the greatest discount among them will be applied.

This is useful if you have a large discount that you never want to stack regardless of whether the curler meets the criteria for any other.

### Discount Inclusions[​](#discount-inclusions "Direct link to Discount Inclusions")

Discount inclusions are useful when you want to limit a discount to only specific curlers. Usually this is used to provide a grandfathered discount to lifetime or shareholder curlers when you're no longer selling these lifetime or shareholder products (otherwise product based criteria is better).

To access discount inclusions, click the name of the discount from the discounts listing screen and then click the "Discount inclusions" button near the bottom. Now you can add and remove curlers from its inclusions list.

**Important:** Once you have one or more curlers assigned to a discounts inclusions then no other curlers will qualify for it. You will need to remove all of the curlers from the inclusions list to make it available to other curlers.

## Troubleshooting Discounts[​](#troubleshooting-discounts "Direct link to Troubleshooting Discounts")

We highly recommend keeping your discounts as simple as possible, so you know at a glance who will be receiving a discount and under what conditions.

For those unavoidably complex setups, here are some pointers:

1. Make sure your discount is associated with the item that is to be discounted. If you're discounting leagues, then the discount must be associated with each of those leagues. If you are discounting a fee, then the discount must be associated with that fee. You cannot associate a discount to one item and expect it to apply to another it hasn't been associated with.
2. Make sure that if your discount eligibility is based on a custom field value, that the custom field is also associated everywhere your discount is associated. If you do not, then the question which the discount is based on will never be asked, and no one will receive the discount. For example, if I want to ask curlers if it's their first season and give them a 5% discount on their membership fee if they are, then I need to associate both the custom field to ask the question and the discount itself to the membership fee.
3. If you are using a custom field based discount, you usually do not want to use a checkbox. You would instead use a dropdown with "Yes, No" values so that you can make this custom field required, and to also avoid accidental selection by your curlers.
4. For multiple item discounts, every item (league, program, fee, or product) that will participate in the discount needs to have it associated.
5. If a discount is seasonal per curler (should only be received once per season), then the item being discounted must require a curler profile. Otherwise there's no way for the system to know if a curler has already received it.
6. Multi item discounts are based on curler profile (not account) and will only work if the items to be discounted are requiring a curler profile.
7. Discounts are additive based on the full price of the item being discounted. Discounts do not compound (you never discount a previously discounted price). For example if I apply two 10% discounts to a league that costs $100, then my total potential discounts are $20.
8. In general you should avoid mixing both fixed price and percentage based discounts, or it can be very hard to reason about.

# Emails

The Emails feature allows you to manage both broadcast emails and transactional email templates for your club. You can send announcements to your members and customize the automated emails that are sent when members make purchases, payments, and receive refunds.

## Finding Emails[​](#finding-emails "Direct link to Finding Emails")

Within your admin area, click on the **Club** dropdown menu in the top bar and then click on **Emails**.

![Navigation](/assets/images/navigation-17979f36a4d042aa948aa9fe43b22212.png)

This will take you to the Email Broadcasts page. You'll see two tabs at the top:

* **Email Broadcasts** - Send announcements and newsletters to your members
* **Transactional** - Customize automated email templates for purchases, payments, and refunds

## Email Broadcasts[​](#email-broadcasts "Direct link to Email Broadcasts")

Email broadcasts allow you to send announcements, newsletters, and other communications to groups of your members. This feature uses a credit system to ensure fair usage across all clubs.

### Understanding Email Credits[​](#understanding-email-credits "Direct link to Understanding Email Credits")

Email credits are used to send broadcast emails. Each email sent to one recipient uses one credit. For example, sending an email to 50 members uses 50 credits.

#### How You Earn Credits[​](#how-you-earn-credits "Direct link to How You Earn Credits")

You automatically receive email credits in three ways:

**1. Premium Subscription Renewals**

When you purchase or renew a Premium subscription, you are granted email credits that fill your balance up to **6,000 credits**. These credits can be used for broadcast emails throughout your subscription period.

**2. Monthly Automatic Grants**

If your club processes online payments through Curling IO (leagues, competitions, products, fees), you automatically earn email credits each month based on your payment processing volume:

* Credits are granted on the 1st of each month for the previous month's activity
* Auto-granted credits from renewals and monthly allocations are subject to a 6,000 credit cap, meaning automatic grants will only add credits up to this limit

**3. Direct Purchases**

You can purchase additional email credits at any time if you need more than your automatic grants provide:

1. Go to **Club** → **Emails** → **Email Broadcasts** tab
2. Click the **Purchase Credits** button
3. Select a credit package from the available options

Purchased credits are not subject to the 6,000 credit cap that applies to automatic grants, so your balance can exceed this limit. Credits never expire and will remain in your account until used.

#### Credit Balance[​](#credit-balance "Direct link to Credit Balance")

You can view your current credit balance and usage history on the **Email Broadcasts** page.

![Email Broadcasts](/assets/images/broadcast-list-573c061da09580e19e3c15fe6b819377.png)

### Sending a Broadcast Email[​](#sending-a-broadcast-email "Direct link to Sending a Broadcast Email")

The easiest way to send a broadcast email is to start from one of your reports, which allows you to filter your members and then send them an email.

#### Step 1: Select Your Recipients[​](#step-1-select-your-recipients "Direct link to Step 1: Select Your Recipients")

1. Navigate to any order items report (Leagues, Competitions, Programs, Products, Fees, etc.) under the **Reports** section
2. Use the report's filters to narrow down your recipients (e.g., only members from a specific league or season)
3. Click the **Send Broadcast Email to These Recipients** button at the top of the filtered results

This will extract all unique email addresses from your filtered results and take you to the email composer.

#### Step 2: Compose Your Email[​](#step-2-compose-your-email "Direct link to Step 2: Compose Your Email")

![Email Composer](/assets/images/broadcast-compose-ac628be9db90c527857a3c0bd0d3c0e6.png)

On the email composer page, you'll see:

* **Your current credit balance** and how many credits this email will use
* **Recipient list** showing all email addresses that will receive the email
* **Subject** - The email subject line
* **Body** - The email message content

Fill in your subject and body, review the recipient list to ensure it's correct, and verify you have enough credits to send.

#### Step 3: Send[​](#step-3-send "Direct link to Step 3: Send")

Click the **Send Email** button to queue your broadcast. The credits will be deducted from your balance immediately, and the emails will be sent in the background.

You can view the status of your sent broadcasts by going to **Club** → **Emails** → **Email Broadcasts** tab. The page shows both your current credit balance and a chronological list of all activity including:

* Sent broadcasts (showing subject, date, and credits used)
* Credit grants from purchases, premium renewals, and monthly allocations
* Your current credit balance at the top of the page

## Transactional Email Templates[​](#transactional-email-templates "Direct link to Transactional Email Templates")

Transactional emails are the automated emails that Curling IO sends on your behalf when your members interact with your club. These include:

* **Order submitted (cash/cheque)** - Email sent when a member submits an order but hasn't paid yet
* **Order paid (online)** - Receipt email sent when a member completes an online payment
* **Payment recorded (at club)** - Email sent when you record a payment made at the club
* **Refund issued (at club)** - Email sent when you record a refund

### Customizing Transactional Email Templates[​](#customizing-transactional-email-templates "Direct link to Customizing Transactional Email Templates")

To customize these email templates:

1. Go to **Club** → **Emails** → **Transactional** tab
2. You'll see a list of all available email templates
3. Click **Customize** next to the email you want to edit

![Transactional Templates](/assets/images/transactional-list-3425f01450654874e806863553bcdd02.png)

On the customization page, you can modify:

* **Subject line** - Customize the email subject
* **Email body** - Edit the message content using the template variables provided
* **Preview** - See how the email will look to your members

### Template Variables[​](#template-variables "Direct link to Template Variables")

Transactional emails support template variables that are automatically replaced with actual data when the email is sent. Common variables include:

* Member name
* Order details
* Payment amount
* Club information

The available variables are shown on each template customization page.

### Resetting Templates[​](#resetting-templates "Direct link to Resetting Templates")

If you want to return a template to its original default content, click the **Reset to Default** button on the template customization page. This will discard your changes and restore the original template.

## Email Sending Best Practices[​](#email-sending-best-practices "Direct link to Email Sending Best Practices")

* **Check your filters** - Before sending a broadcast, double-check that your report filters are selecting the right recipients
* **Review your balance** - Make sure you have enough credits before composing large broadcasts
* **Test first** - Consider sending a test broadcast to yourself or a small group before sending to all members

## Frequently Asked Questions[​](#frequently-asked-questions "Direct link to Frequently Asked Questions")

**Q: What happens if I don't have enough credits to send a broadcast?**

A: The Send button will be disabled and you'll see a message indicating you need more credits. You can either wait for your next monthly grant or purchase additional credits.

**Q: Can I schedule broadcasts to send later?**

A: Not at this time. Broadcasts are sent immediately when you click the Send button.

**Q: Who can send broadcast emails?**

A: Any club manager with access to your admin area can compose and send broadcast emails.

**Q: What email address do broadcasts come from?**

A: Broadcast emails are sent from `broadcast@curling.io` with your club name in the "From" field. Replies go to your club's main email address that you have configured in your club settings.

**Q: Can recipients unsubscribe from broadcast emails?**

A: Yes, all broadcast emails include an unsubscribe link at the bottom. If a recipient clicks the unsubscribe link or marks a broadcast email as spam, they will not receive any future broadcast emails from your club. Note that this only affects broadcast emails - they will still receive transactional emails (receipts, payment confirmations, etc.).

# Fees

You can set up membership and capital improvement fees for your club.

Most fees are seasonal, but they aren't required to be. For example a Competitor Card Fee for provincial competitions is typically not a seasonal fee and can therefore be purchased multiple times per season.

Fees are not automatically associated with your leagues, competitions, and products. They must be associated explicitly to each league, competition, and product where they will be applied. You do this by editing the league, competition, or product and adding the relevant fees in the **Addons and Fees** section.

You will see any affiliate fees you are inheriting from your membership association here. Like the Curling Canada fee and the relevant membership association fee. You cannot edit or delete these inherited fees, but like all other fees, they are not automatically associated with your leagues, products, or competitions, and must be explicitly assigned.

## The Basics[​](#the-basics "Direct link to The Basics")

### Naming your Fee[​](#naming-your-fee "Direct link to Naming your Fee")

This is the name that will be displayed to your members when they come to register on Curling IO.

Fees can and should be reused between seasons, so there's no need to include a year or season in the name unless you specifically do not want to reuse it next year.

### Pricing & Tax[​](#pricing--tax "Direct link to Pricing & Tax")

When you set the pricing for your fee, we highly recommend breaking out the tax, both for transparency to your members, but also to make it easier for your bookkeeping.

There is a handy tax calculator which will show you what your total with tax will be in case you want to untangle taxes from your existing pricing.

![Tax Calculator](/assets/images/tax-calculator-90b6d6968e3abec4a8f954df3353c928.png)

### Requiring a Curler Profile[​](#requiring-a-curler-profile "Direct link to Requiring a Curler Profile")

When you require a curler profile you are forcing the fee to only be applied for **individual** registrations. You'll want to check this box for membership type fees. This is checked by default for new fees.

If the *requires a curler profile* option is selected you can also specify whether or not the fee is seasonal per curler. By checking the seasonal per curler box you are ensuring that the curler won't be asked to purchase this fee more than once in a given season. This is checked by default for new fees.

### Seasonal per curler[​](#seasonal-per-curler "Direct link to Seasonal per curler")

You can restrict the fee so that it can't be paid more than once per curler per season. You must require a curler profile as well for this to work.

If, however, the fee should be paid each time they register (for a league / product / competition that includes the fee) then make sure this is unchecked.

This is checked by default since most fees are seasonal.

### Active[​](#active "Direct link to Active")

If you need to disable a fee temporarily you can uncheck the **Active** box. When a fee is disabled it cannot be added to leagues, competitions, or products, and will not be charged to your members for anything it is already associated to.

## Criteria[​](#criteria "Direct link to Criteria")

Criteria determines how and when the fee will be applied. For example an adults only fee would have a min age requirement prevent it from being added when a youth curler is registering.

Criteria are cumulative, meaning that if you have multiple criteria set, they must all evaluate to true in order for the fee to be applied.

### Min and Max Age[​](#min-and-max-age "Direct link to Min and Max Age")

You can restrict a fee to specific ages. The age restrictions are inclusive, meaning that entering a min age of "18" will include 18 year olds. Age restrictions use your club's [age calculation configuration](/docs/club-management/settings.md#age-cutoff). By default, ages are calculated as of the day before your season starts (e.g., June 30th if your season starts July 1st). So if a curler is not 18 or older based on your club's age calculation date, they will not be asked to pay a fee with a min age of 18.

### Days after open[​](#days-after-open "Direct link to Days after open")

The days after open criteria is how you would implement a *Late Fee*.

For example, a value of 30 means that if someone registers for a league implementing this fee, they will be required to pay the fee if they register 30 or more days after registration opened.

## Accounting Codes[​](#accounting-codes "Direct link to Accounting Codes")

If you've enabled accounting in your [Club Settings](/docs/club-management/settings.md#accounting), you'll see an **Accounting Codes** section when creating or editing a fee.

Most clubs only use the default account code set in Club Settings. However, you can optionally add Class and Project codes here to differentiate between fee types (e.g., membership vs. capital improvement) or track by age group.

**For complete details and examples, see the [Accounting Codes Guide](/docs/accounting/accounting-codes.md).**

## Adding Custom Fields[​](#adding-custom-fields "Direct link to Adding Custom Fields")

Custom fields allow you to ask your curlers questions specific to your club that we haven't thought of during registration.

Keep in mind that for individual registration where you require a curler profile, you shouldn't need to add custom fields for general curler data as this will already be associated with the registration.

![Custom Fields](/assets/images/custom-fields-1e316b3353f0fe8ad8b26497a2c2a0ec.png)

## Assigning Discounts[​](#assigning-discounts "Direct link to Assigning Discounts")

You can apply discounts to your fees that depend on the registrant meeting specific criteria.

![Assigning Discounts](/assets/images/discounts-390940e0f676e9d2ffd15dd26f612306.png)

The criteria is extremely flexible, and more details and examples can be found in the [discounts section.](/docs/club-management/discounts.md)

# Integrations

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

Integrations connect Curling IO with the external services your club already relies on, keeping data synchronized and automating tasks that would otherwise require manual exports or imports.

* **Mailchimp** — Sync member contact details and registration tags to your marketing audience so mailing lists stay current.
* **QuickBooks Online** — Push online payment payout data into QuickBooks and track sync health directly from the integration dashboard.
* **External Calendar** — Mirror events from an iCal/WebCal feed (like Google Calendar) so your club calendar stays in step with your other schedules.

## Finding Integrations[​](#finding-integrations "Direct link to Finding Integrations")

Within your admin area, click on the **Club** dropdown menu in the top bar and then click on **Integrations**.

![Navigation](/assets/images/navigation-8e705c0230cfe50bc5f18c0ce79c22b5.png)

## Mailchimp[​](#mailchimp "Direct link to Mailchimp")

Connect your Curling IO member and registration data to a Mailchimp audience so lists stay up to date without manual exports.

![Mailchimp Integration](/assets/images/mailchimp-integration-072c010b7b473493097f0677f0cdbd5b.png)

### What gets synced[​](#what-gets-synced "Direct link to What gets synced")

* Member profile fields map to Mailchimp merge fields when present: `ID`, `EMAIL`, `FNAME`, `LNAME`, `PHONE`, `GENDER`, `DOB`, `PCODE`, and mailing address components (`addr1`, `city`, `state`, `zip`, `country`).
* Completed registrations add Mailchimp tags for the item name and, when applicable, the event category (e.g., `Bonspiels`).

### Set up the connection[​](#set-up-the-connection "Direct link to Set up the connection")

1. Navigate to **Admin → Integrations** and open the Mailchimp panel.
2. Enter a Mailchimp API key (create one via [Mailchimp’s API key guide](https://mailchimp.com/help/about-api-keys/)).
3. Provide the target Audience (List) ID (see [Mailchimp’s audience ID instructions](https://mailchimp.com/help/find-audience-id/)).
4. Save. Curling IO verifies the credentials and begins syncing changes automatically.

The integrations page shows the last successful sync time and any recent Mailchimp errors.

### Common errors[​](#common-errors "Direct link to Common errors")

* **“Data did not match any of the schemas described in anyOf”** — A merge field in Mailchimp rejected the data. Make sure optional fields stay optional or match Curling IO formats (for example, phone numbers formatted like `+1 403-555-1234`).
* **“Invalid Resource”, “Member is in a compliance state”, “Permanently deleted”** — The contact cannot be updated via the API. Ask the member to resubscribe directly through Mailchimp.
* **API key or datacenter errors** — Confirm the API key is active and belongs to the same datacenter as the target audience.

## QuickBooks Online[​](#quickbooks-online "Direct link to QuickBooks Online")

Connect Curling IO with QuickBooks Online so online payment payouts land inside your accounting ledger without manual exports. OAuth credentials stay in the integration record, letting you manage access entirely from the admin panel.

![QuickBooks Online Integration](/assets/images/quickbooks-online-integration-f511021a431995d8d8635d3c293386b5.png)

### Connection actions[​](#connection-actions "Direct link to Connection actions")

* **Connect QuickBooks** — Launches the Intuit OAuth flow; sign in with a QuickBooks admin for the company that should receive your online payment data.
* **Reconnect** — Runs the OAuth handshake again when tokens are expiring or you need to switch companies. Use this as soon as you see token warnings or authorization-related sync failures.
* **Disconnect** — Severs the link, clears stored tokens, disables automatic sync jobs, and marks the integration inactive.

### Status card fields[​](#status-card-fields "Direct link to Status card fields")

* **Status** — `Connected` after a successful sync, `Not connected` when tokens are missing or invalid, `Pending` immediately after setup, `Failed` when the most recent sync hit an error, and `Disabled` after a manual disconnect.
* **Last synced** — Timestamp of the latest successful import (`Never` until the first run finishes).
* **Consecutive failures** — Count of consecutive sync errors; resets to `0` once a job succeeds.
* **Company ID** — Displays the QuickBooks realm/company currently authorized, or `Pending` until one is saved.
* **Credentials updated** — When OAuth tokens were last refreshed.
* **Refresh token expires** — Expiration date for the long-lived refresh token. The status card warns inside seven days of expiry and flips to `Failed` once the date passes.
* **Access token expires** — Short-lived token expiry for reference.
* **Recent errors** — Chronological list of failed sync attempts with timestamps and the message returned from Curling IO or Intuit.

### Configuration form fields[​](#configuration-form-fields "Direct link to Configuration form fields")

* **Deposit bank (`default_bank_account_id`)** — QuickBooks bank account that should receive online payment deposits.
* **Online payments clearing (`card_clearing_id`)** — Clearing or undeposited funds account that the accountant reconciles against.
* **Processing fee expense (`processing_fee_expense_id`)** — Expense account that captures online payment processing fees.
* **Notification email** — Optional address for sync failure alerts; defaults to the club email when left blank.
* **Active** — Master toggle for the integration; turn it off to pause sync jobs (status becomes `Disabled`).

### Workflow tips[​](#workflow-tips "Direct link to Workflow tips")

1. Fill in all mapping fields before clicking **Connect** so the first sync can post without corrections.
2. Keep an eye on the refresh-token expiry and run **Reconnect** before the date arrives to avoid authorization failures.
3. After any failure, review **Recent errors**—most issues stem from missing mappings, expired tokens, or unexpected QuickBooks API responses.
4. If you disconnect, the account mappings remain in place, but no new data flows until you connect again.

## External Calendar[​](#external-calendar "Direct link to External Calendar")

Import events from an external iCal/WebCal feed and display them alongside your Curling IO events.

![External Calendar Integration](/assets/images/external-calendar-integration-4f5dc59b37fe5bef5e758e038cf3edb8.png)

### Configure the feed[​](#configure-the-feed "Direct link to Configure the feed")

1. In **Admin → Club Dropdown → Integrations**, open the External Calendar panel.
2. Provide the subscription URL for the iCal/WebCal feed you want to mirror.
3. (Optional) Add a notification email to receive sync error alerts.
4. Enable the integration to start nightly syncs. You can disable or re-run syncs manually from this screen.

### Find your Google Calendar public URL[​](#find-your-google-calendar-public-url "Direct link to Find your Google Calendar public URL")

1. Open [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com) in a browser and click the gear icon → **Settings**.
2. Under **Settings for my calendars**, pick the calendar you want to share.
3. (Optional) If you want a publicly shareable feed, check **Make available to public** in the **Access permissions for events** section.
4. In **Integrate calendar**, copy the **Public address in iCal format**.
5. If you prefer to keep the feed private, use the **Secret address in iCal format** instead and keep it confidential.

### Sync behavior[​](#sync-behavior "Direct link to Sync behavior")

* Curling IO fetches the feed nightly using conditional requests (ETag/Last-Modified) to reduce traffic, and shows the last sync status and any failure messages in the integration panel.
* Recurring events are expanded, cancellations are respected, and stale occurrences fall out automatically when they disappear from the feed.
* Only events within the active sync window are stored; older items are purged after about three months to keep the view concise.
* Sync failures trigger retries and, when you provide a notification email, send an alert so issues can be resolved quickly.

If the feed includes malformed entries (missing `UID`, `DTSTART`, etc.), they are skipped but reported in the integration status so you can follow up with the feed provider.

# Leagues & Competitions

## Walkthrough Video[​](#walkthrough-video "Direct link to Walkthrough Video")

The following video will take you, the curling club manager, through the basics of creating a league and opening up registrations. Competitions are identical except that for a competition you will usually not require a profile, as they will be team based registrations. If you're new to Curling IO, it's worthwhile to watch this before wading through the rest of our documentation.

## Finding your Leagues and Competitions[​](#finding-your-leagues-and-competitions "Direct link to Finding your Leagues and Competitions")

Within your admin area, click on **Leagues** or **Competitions** in the top bar.

## Filling in the Form[​](#filling-in-the-form "Direct link to Filling in the Form")

### Naming your League or Competition[​](#naming-your-league-or-competition "Direct link to Naming your League or Competition")

This is the name that will be displayed to your members when they come to register on Curling IO.

For leagues we recommend including the Day of the week, night or day, and type of league here. E.g. "Monday Night Men's".

Some clubs will also include the year, but this is generally unnecessary and entirely at your preference since leagues and competitions are filtered by season when member's visit the listing pages. E.g. "Monday Night Men's - 2020"

### Start & End Dates[​](#start--end-dates "Direct link to Start & End Dates")

The start and end dates indicate when your league or competition runs. These aren't to be confused with when the league or competition registration opens and closes.

### Active[​](#active "Direct link to Active")

If you need to disable a league or competition temporarily you can uncheck the **Active** box. When a league or competition is disabled it cannot be seen or purchased by your members.

### Summary & Description[​](#summary--description "Direct link to Summary & Description")

When you enter a summary, it will show up on the list view of your leagues or competitions when members come to Curling IO. For leagues, we recommend entering your draw times. E.g. 7:00 & 9:00 PM

The description shows up when your members click on the name of the league or competition and also when they assign a profile or fill in required information for it. Keep in mind that member's may just add the league or competition to their cart without clicking on it's name.

### Skill Level[​](#skill-level "Direct link to Skill Level")

You can indicate a skill level for your events ranging from beginner to advanced or even professional.

### Required Reading[​](#required-reading "Direct link to Required Reading")

You can enter some text that your members are guaranteed to see before they can complete their registration for the league. Just leave this blank to avoid this registration step.

We recommend you use this sparingly as it adds another step (friction) to league registrations for your members.

### Sponsorship[​](#sponsorship "Direct link to Sponsorship")

You can optionally upload a sponsor image and provide a Sponsored By line. This will only appear in the detailed view of your league or competition when member's click on the name.

### Open & Close Dates[​](#open--close-dates "Direct link to Open & Close Dates")

You must specify an open and a close date before your members can register for the league or competition. This determines when it is available for registration / purchase.

Before the open date has occurred, members will be shown that date that registration will open.

Once the close date has passed, members will be shown that registration is closed.

### Pricing & Tax[​](#pricing--tax "Direct link to Pricing & Tax")

When you set the pricing for your league or competition, we highly recommend breaking out the tax, both for transparency to your members, but also to make it easier for your bookkeeping.

There is a handy tax calculator which will show you what your total with tax will be in case you want to untangle taxes from your existing pricing.

![Tax Calculator](/assets/images/tax-calculator-90b6d6968e3abec4a8f954df3353c928.png)

For league registrations you will also want to break out the affiliate fees and let Curling IO handle them for you. If you include the affiliate fees as required in the [Addons section](#assigning-fees--addons) then Curling IO will ensure that every curler who registers for the league will also pay the affiliate fees. We also make sure they only pay them once per season, by omitting seasonal fees in future league registrations for the same season. It's also much easier to report on for bookkeeping and when it comes to figuring out your club's remittance.

### Requiring a Curler Profile[​](#requiring-a-curler-profile "Direct link to Requiring a Curler Profile")

When you require a profile you are forcing registrations to be **individual** only.

We highly recommend requiring a profile for your league registrations. It's required for the system to apply seasonal membership and affiliate fees, and multiple item discounts. The system needs to know who (profile) has paid their fees already for the season so that they aren't charged again in future registrations.

As an example, if Sue registers for the Monday Night Ladies league and pays her membership and affiliate fees, then later registers for a Wednesday Night Mixed league, the system is smart enough not to double charge her membership and affiliate fees. Also if Sue's club was running a multi-item discount like 20% off the second item, then the system needs to know how many items (leagues, programs, fees, products) she has already purchased in order to apply the discount appropriately.

For competition / bonspiel registrations you usually do not want to require a profile, since these are usually team registrations and membership or affiliate fees are irrelevant.

### Seasonal per curler[​](#seasonal-per-curler "Direct link to Seasonal per curler")

If you are requiring a profile, then checking the seasonal per curler checkbox will prevent this league from being purchase for the same curler more than once in the same season. We highly recommend you use this for seasonal leagues as this can reduce mistaken purchases where a user really meant to usea different profile or didn't realize they had the league in their cart more than once.

### Private[​](#private "Direct link to Private")

You can check this box to make a league or competition available **only** to those that have been given a unique URL to click. This is typically used to offer early access to a league or competition for returning members.

If you check this box then once you save the league or competition, a unique URL will be generated for it. You can copy this unique URL and send it to the subset of members you want to be able to purchase it. To find this URL simply click on the name of the league or competition on the administrator product listing page.

### Notification email[​](#notification-email "Direct link to Notification email")

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

If you'd like someone to be notified every time the league or competition is purchased you can enter their email address here. You can enter more than one email address separated by commas.

We don't perform any email validations on this field, so please make sure you don't have a typo or a defunct email address or they won't receive the notifications.

We also don't recommend using this feature for fellow managers since they will have access to the same information from within the admin area, and sending notification emails get spammy.

### Spots Available[​](#spots-available "Direct link to Spots Available")

You can restrict the number of registrations for your event. If it's an individual registration (requires a profile) then this should be how many curlers can register for it. If it's a team registration (does not require a profile) then this should be the number of teams that can register for it.

### Maximum Teams[​](#maximum-teams "Direct link to Maximum Teams")

When you're doing **individual registrations** (requires curler profile is checked), you can use the **Maximum Teams** setting to limit the number of unique teams that can register, separate from the total number of individual registrations.

This is most commonly used for leagues where curlers register individually, but you still want to control how many teams participate. For example, you might allow 40 individual curlers to register, but limit it to 8 unique teams.

**Note:** This setting only appears when "Requires curler" is checked. For team registrations (where entire teams register together), you don't need Maximum Teams - simply use the **Spots Available** setting to limit the number of teams directly.

**How it works with Spots Available:**

The two limits work independently:

* **Spots Available** controls the total number of registrations
* **Maximum Teams** controls the number of unique teams

**Example:** A league with 40 spots available and a maximum of 8 teams means you can have up to 8 different teams register, with a total of 40 curlers across all teams (an average of 5 curlers per team).

**Requirements:**

To use Maximum Teams:

* **Requires curler** must be checked (this enables individual registrations)
* Either **Team Name** or **Skip Name** must be configured as a **required** field (not just optional)

This is how the system identifies which registrations belong to the same team.

**What registrants see:**

When you're asking for Team Name or Skip Name during individual registrations (requires a profile), registrants will see a dropdown showing existing teams:

* Teams that have been pre-created for the event (if any)
* Unique team names from existing registrations

For example, if you've pre-created "Team A" and "Team B", and someone has registered with "Team C", the dropdown will show all three options.

**How Maximum Teams affects the dropdown:**

The Maximum Teams setting doesn't control whether the dropdown appears—it only controls whether registrants can create new teams:

* **Without Maximum Teams set**: The dropdown always includes an "Other..." option, allowing registrants to create new teams
* **With Maximum Teams set but not reached**: The "Other..." option is available and registrants can create new teams
* **When the team limit is reached**: The "Other..." option disappears and registrants must select from existing teams only
* Admin users can always bypass the team limit and create new teams if needed

Leave this field blank if you don't need to limit the number of teams.

### Waitlist enabled[​](#waitlist-enabled "Direct link to Waitlist enabled")

Check this box if you want members to be able to add their name to a waitlist when there are no longer spots available. This only works if you've restricted the spots available.

More details and examples can be found in the [waitlists section.](/docs/club-management/waitlists.md)

### Publish Registrations[​](#publish-registrations "Direct link to Publish Registrations")

If you would like to publicly show who has registered for a league or competition you can check this box. Only the curler's name, team or skip name, position, and lineup will be shown. No other information collected through custom fields or from the profile will be shown.

The reason to publish registrations is so that other members can see who has already registered, like a friend or family member, when they are deciding to register themself. Similar to a bulletin board at the club.

### Min and Max Age[​](#min-and-max-age "Direct link to Min and Max Age")

If you are requiring a profile (individual instead of team registration) then you can restrict the age of members who can register. The age restrictions are inclusive, meaning that entering a min age of "18" will include 18 year olds. Age restrictions use your club's [age calculation configuration](/docs/club-management/settings.md#age-cutoff). By default, ages are calculated as of the day before your season starts (e.g., June 30th if your season starts July 1st). So if a curler is not 18 or older based on your club's age calculation date, they will be prevented from registering for a league with a min age of 18.

### Post registration message[​](#post-registration-message "Direct link to Post registration message")

This is a message that your members will see after they purchase the league or competition. The message is displayed both on the thank you screen and in the email they receive after purchase. Use this to provide follow up instructions to your members, like a reminder (possibly with a link) to ask their teammates to register.

### Team or Skip Name[​](#team-or-skip-name "Direct link to Team or Skip Name")

If you want to leverage Curling IO team recommendations then you must ask for either a team or a skip name during registration. Our team recommendations just make it easier and automate team creation if that's a feature you want to use. You can make the team and skip name optional, required, or even restrict team names to the list of existing teams (useful if you are pre-creating teams).

**For individual registrations** (requires a profile): When you ask for a team or skip name, registrants will see a dropdown of existing teams, including any pre-created teams and teams from prior registrations. They can typically select an existing team or create a new one via the "Other..." option.

**Important:** If you are using the [Maximum Teams](#maximum-teams) feature to limit the number of unique teams, you must configure either Team Name or Skip Name as **required** (not just optional). This is how the system identifies which registrations belong to the same team and enforces the team limit.

If you aren't planning to use Curling IO to set up teams, round robins, and draw schedules, then asking for a team or skip name is just a club preference for reporting purposes.

### Curler's Position[​](#curlers-position "Direct link to Curler's Position")

If you ask for the curlers position and are using our team recommendations for a league or competitions, then the position your curlers choose will be reflected in the recommended teams.

### Lineups & Number of Alternates[​](#lineups--number-of-alternates "Direct link to Lineups & Number of Alternates")

Usually you wouldn't want to ask for lineup information for individual league registrations otherwise every member of the team will be entering it in duplicate and triplicate when each of the register.

However, this can be useful for competitions that are typically done as team registrations if you need to know who will be participating.

### Publish Schedule and Results[​](#publish-schedule-and-results "Direct link to Publish Schedule and Results")

If you are using Curling IO's team assembly, round robin generation, draw schedules, and scoring then you'll likey want to check this box. This will publish your schedule, standings, and teams on the public side of your site.

If you are not planning to use these features within Curling IO, we recommend you leave this unchecked to avoid confusion.

### Allow Spares[​](#allow-spares "Direct link to Allow Spares")

Curling IO has a sparing feature where members can choose which leagues and competitions they are available to spare for. The use of this feature does not require members to have purchased anything, but simply to have added a profile and accepted your waivers. Curler can also indicate which positions they can spare for, and any notes they may have about sparing and availability.

[Refer to our curler sparing documentation for more info.](/docs/for-curlers/sparing.md)

### Participant Scoring[​](#participant-scoring "Direct link to Participant Scoring")

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

Check this box if you want your participants to be able to score games on their own. In order for this to work though you will need to create teams and assign profiles to them, or we won't know who your participants are. End scores are not supported by participant scoring yet. Users access participant scoring for their games from their [Account -> My teams section](/docs/for-curlers/teams.md).

### End Scores Enabled[​](#end-scores-enabled "Direct link to End Scores Enabled")

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

If you want to be able to score each of the ends for each team for the league or competition, you can check this box to enable end scores. [Refer to our scoring documentation to see how this works.](/docs/event-management/scores.md)

### Team coach name, and affiliation[​](#team-coach-name-and-affiliation "Direct link to Team coach name, and affiliation")

These are options available to membership associations.

You can ask registrants to enter their coach name and affiliation (club they are representing). This information will be copied over to the team if you use our team recommendation engine.

### Team contact name, phone, and email[​](#team-contact-name-phone-and-email "Direct link to Team contact name, phone, and email")

You can ask registrants to enter a contact name, phone number, and email address for their team. If you are already requiring profiles then you probably don't need this since you will have the profile as your contact. This is used mostly in competitions when you are taking team registrations instead of individuals with profiles. This information will be copied over to the team if you use our team recommendation engine.

### Publish Team Contact Information[​](#publish-team-contact-information "Direct link to Publish Team Contact Information")

If you are using Curling IO's team assembly, and are entering contact information for your teams, then you can choose whether or not to show this information. This only works if you are also publishing the schedules and results.

## Assigning Fees & Addons[​](#assigning-fees--addons "Direct link to Assigning Fees & Addons")

All fees and addons that should be added to the cost of the league or competition can be added here. Keep in mind that just creating a fee doesn't not automatically associate it to your leagues and competitions. You need to specify which fees and addons are relevant for each league or competition, as this will almost always vary between events. E.g. junior and learn to curl leagues may not have any fees.

![Addons and Fees](/assets/images/addons-and-fees-2494190ac1312c1190926ab2c004294e.png)

Examples of fees are your provincial and national affiliate fees, but also any membership or capital improvement fees you may have at the club.

Examples of addons are lockers, grippers, helmets. Any product that you want to include as a required or optional addon to the league or competition.

[You can find information about fees here.](/docs/club-management/fees.md)

## Adding Custom Fields[​](#adding-custom-fields "Direct link to Adding Custom Fields")

Custom fields allow you to ask your members questions specific to your club that we haven't thought of during registration.

Keep in mind that for individual registration where you require a profile, you shouldn't need to add custom fields for general curler data as this will already be associated with the registration.

For a competition / bonspiel registration you might want to add some custom fields to capture contact information should you need it.

Like fees, keep in mind that custom fields are not automatically added to all of your leagues and competitions. You need to specify which custom fields are relevant for each league or competition, as this will often vary between events.

![Custom Fields](/assets/images/custom-fields-1e316b3353f0fe8ad8b26497a2c2a0ec.png)

[You can find information about custom fields here.](/docs/club-management/custom-fields.md)

## Assigning Discounts[​](#assigning-discounts "Direct link to Assigning Discounts")

You can apply discounts to your leagues and competitions that depend on the registrant meeting specific criteria. Keep in mind that just creating a discount doesn't not automatically associate it to your leagues and competitions. You need to specify which discounts are relevant for each league and competition, as this will often vary.

![Assigning Discounts](/assets/images/discounts-390940e0f676e9d2ffd15dd26f612306.png)

### Examples of Discounts[​](#examples-of-discounts "Direct link to Examples of Discounts")

#### Example 1: Second League Purchased[​](#example-1-second-league-purchased "Direct link to Example 1: Second League Purchased")

Give the registering profile a 20% discount if this is the second league they are purchasing this season.

#### Example 2: Under 18[​](#example-2-under-18 "Direct link to Example 2: Under 18")

Give the registering profile a 50% discount if they are under 18 years old as of July 1st in the year that the season began.

#### Example 3: Early Bird Discount[​](#example-3-early-bird-discount "Direct link to Example 3: Early Bird Discount")

Give the registering profile a $10 fixed discount if they register at least 90 days before registration closes for the league.

#### Example 4: First Time Member[​](#example-4-first-time-member "Direct link to Example 4: First Time Member")

Give the registering profile a 5% discount if this is the first time they've registered with your club. This is an example of a custom field based discount and you'd be responsible for making sure members don't select the option when they shouldn't.

More details and examples can be found in the [discounts section.](/docs/club-management/discounts.md)

## Accounting Codes[​](#accounting-codes "Direct link to Accounting Codes")

If you've enabled accounting in your [Club Settings](/docs/club-management/settings.md#accounting), you'll see an **Accounting Codes** section when creating or editing a league or competition.

Most clubs only use the default account codes set in Club Settings. However, you can optionally add Class and Project codes here to track revenue by demographics (e.g., MENS, WOMENS), skill level, grant funding, or special initiatives.

**For complete details and examples, see the [Accounting Codes Guide](/docs/accounting/accounting-codes.md).**

## Copying a League for the new Season[​](#copying-a-league-for-the-new-season "Direct link to Copying a League for the new Season")

In Curling IO you **NEVER reuse leagues or competitions across multiple seasons**. We keep the previous season's leagues and competitions for their historical data. This is useful for reporting / accounting, but also for curlers to see results and standings from a previous season if you are using our [event management features](/docs/event-management/registrations.md).

When you copy a league or competition, you are presented with a pre-filled form. The start, end, registration open, and registration close dates will be prefilled with one year added to each of them. You will want to tweak these dates to make the weekday's line up for the new season. You will also want to remove the "(Copy)" from the name (we do this to make it obvious you are copying).

Usually that's all you'll need to do to set up your leagues and competitions for the new season.

# Linking your Website to Curling IO Registration

If you are not [using Curling IO to host your website](/docs/club-management/website-hosting.md), you'll still want to link to your Curling IO site for registrations. You'll need to do this in order for your members to find the Curling IO registration.

This is a very straightforward process. Simply add a "Register Online" button to your existing website, linking it to your public facing Curling IO site.

You can also leverage our widget, but it will require a little more technical knowledge, or access to someone technical who can assist you. [Registration Widget](/docs/club-management/registration-widget.md)

## Code Example[​](#code-example "Direct link to Code Example")

```
<a href="https://club-name.curling.io">Register Online</a>
```

\*\* Replace `club-name` with your custom Curling IO URL. For example: `https://demo.curling.io`

# Managers

Clubs can have multiple managers for Curling IO. Each of the managers is granted the same level of access.

If you want to give access to an outside party for just a specific league or competition, then you don't add them as a club manager. [You can find information about event managers here](/docs/event-management/event-managers.md).

## Finding Managers[​](#finding-managers "Direct link to Finding Managers")

You can access the list of all the managers at your club, by clicking on **Managers** in the top right **Club** dropdown in the top navigation bar.

![Managers Navigation](/assets/images/navigation-d2b7d62a6baa134ee1bcaa9d431857db.png)

## Adding Managers[​](#adding-managers "Direct link to Adding Managers")

You can add another manager to your club by entering their name and email address into the form at the top of the screen and clicking the **Create Manager** button.

Curling IO will send an email to the email address entered inviting them to join the club management (admin) area. The email will contain a link to the admin dashboard.

We recommend managers bookmark the admin area to avoid confusion between the public and administration sections of your Curling IO site.

## Removing Managers[​](#removing-managers "Direct link to Removing Managers")

We highly recommend that you remove staff from your Curling IO management when they are no longer with the club. You can do so by clicking the **Delete** link next to the manager you wish to remove. This doesn't delete their account, as they may have profiles and participate in leagues themselves, but it does remove them from your club management.

# Orders

## Walkthrough Video[​](#walkthrough-video "Direct link to Walkthrough Video")

The following video will take you, the curling club manager, through the basics of handling orders in Curling IO. If you're new to Curling IO, it's worthwhile to watch this before wading through the rest of our documentation.

## Finding your Orders[​](#finding-your-orders "Direct link to Finding your Orders")

To view and submit a payment for an order, click on the link in the **Summary** column.

## Submitting Payments[​](#submitting-payments "Direct link to Submitting Payments")

If the order has not been fully paid yet (status of **Submitted** or **Partially Paid**), you can submit a payment against it by clicking the **Add a payment** button near the bottom, or selecting Add a payment in the **Actions** dropdown.

You will then be taken to the payment form.

### Payment Form[​](#payment-form "Direct link to Payment Form")

![Submitted a Payment](/assets/images/submitting-a-payment-e9f7c74032d11f4b58cf5435644673c5.png)

The amount of the payment will automatically default to the amount owing. If you're accepting a partial payment you can change it to the appropriate amount.

Optionally you can specify when the payment was or is going to be deposited, and how the payment was made. You can edit these later if you're not sure of the deposit date, or it changed.

You can also optionally add notes to the payment for your own future reference. For example; *Hurly gave Sue a cheque for $180.80 at the bar.*

If your club has online payments set up and enabled, then you'll have the option of using a Credit / Debit card to process the payment. This is useful if a curler calls in with a credit card or brings in a credit card and you don't already have a point of sale system.

## Refunds[​](#refunds "Direct link to Refunds")

To refund an order, click the **Add a refund** button next to a payment near the bottom of the order screen.

![Add a Refund](/assets/images/refund-a-payment-472e065a9d7fbc49a0f7ade994e80078.png)

This opens the refund form where you can select which items to refund and specify the amounts.

### Selecting Items to Refund[​](#selecting-items-to-refund "Direct link to Selecting Items to Refund")

The refund form shows all refundable items from the order with checkboxes. Only items that have been paid (fully or partially) can be refunded.

![Refund Form](/assets/images/refund-form-cb8062ee20dc1af4f8dfc15fdf1ff2a5.png)

**To refund items:**

1. Check the box next to each item you want to refund
2. The refund amount defaults to the full refundable amount for each item
3. You can adjust the amount for partial refunds (see below)
4. Use **Select All** to quickly select all refundable items

**Example:** If you're refunding a Curling Canada Fee because the member already paid it at another club, simply check the fee item and the system shows the full refundable amount.

### Full vs. Partial Refunds[​](#full-vs-partial-refunds "Direct link to Full vs. Partial Refunds")

You can refund an item either fully or partially:

**Full Refund:**

* Refund the entire refundable amount shown
* The item is cancelled and marked as refunded
* For event registrations (leagues, bonspiels, programs), the participant is unregistered
* Inventory is released if quantity-limited

**Partial Refund (Price Adjustment):**

* Change the refund amount to less than the full refundable amount
* The item price is reduced, but the item remains active
* For event registrations, the participant stays registered (useful for partial discounts)
* The item is not marked as cancelled

**Important:** Partial refunds will not remove a registration from an event. Only refunding the full amount will unregister a participant.

### Refund Methods[​](#refund-methods "Direct link to Refund Methods")

**Online Payments (Credit/Debit Card):** If the original payment was made through online payments, you can:

* Refund to the member's original card (recommended)
* Refund to club credits (member gets store credit)
* Refund via another method (cash, cheque, etc.)

The system will autofill the withdrawal date and method when refunding to the original card.

**Offline Payments:** For cash, cheque, or e-transfer payments, you can specify:

* How the refund was made (cash, cheque, club credit, etc.)
* When the funds were withdrawn from the club
* An optional reason for the refund

### Refund Tracking[​](#refund-tracking "Direct link to Refund Tracking")

The system tracks refunds against specific items, which helps with:

* Accurate reporting showing which items were refunded
* Inventory management (releasing quantity-limited spots)
* Registration tracking (unregistering participants for full refunds)
* Accounting transactions (if Premium accounting is enabled)

## Adjusting Submitted Orders[​](#adjusting-submitted-orders "Direct link to Adjusting Submitted Orders")

For submitted (unpaid) orders only, you can add **adjustments** to change the total. An adjustment records as a new line item for the order where you can enter an amount (negative amounts reduce the total) and a description.

Adjustments are typically used to correct a mistake during registration without asking the curler to redo their order. Adjustments can increase bookkeeping effort when balancing your books, so we recommend redoing orders instead, even if you need to login as the curler and order on their behalf.

You cannot make adjustments to orders that have been paid, so it's only relevant to offline orders during their submitted status.

## Sending an Order back to the Account's Cart[​](#sending-an-order-back-to-the-accounts-cart "Direct link to Sending an Order back to the Account's Cart")

For submitted (unpaid) orders only, you can send the order back to the registering account's cart.

You may want to do this when a mistake was made during registration and you'd like the curler to correct the mistake themself, or correct it for them using the **Login as** feature.

You cannot send orders that have been paid back to their cart, so it's only relevant to offline orders during their submitted status.

## Deleting Submitted Orders[​](#deleting-submitted-orders "Direct link to Deleting Submitted Orders")

You can delete submitted (unpaid) orders. This is useful when testing out your discounts and pricing, which we highly recommend doing before sending your curlers to register.

You cannot delete paid orders as this would most definitely unbalance your bookkeeping reports. If an order has offline payments however, you can delete those payments first, and then delete the order itself, as it will be moved back into a submitted state.

## Transferring Orders[​](#transferring-orders "Direct link to Transferring Orders")

You can transfer orders to another account at any time. An account is basically a login represented by an email address. You can only transfer orders to accounts that have been created within Curling IO and thus verified their email address. You cannot transfer an order to a curler who has never logged in.

The reason for transferring an order is to have it show up within the accounts order history. For example, if a curler registered at the club under a dedicated club registration login, you may later want to transfer that order to them once they're using Curling IO.

## Filling in the Form[​](#filling-in-the-form "Direct link to Filling in the Form")

### Naming your Product[​](#naming-your-product "Direct link to Naming your Product")

This is the name that will be displayed to your members when they come to purchase it on Curling IO.

Products don't have a start or end date, so you typical will reuse the same products between seasons. If a product is only available for a specific season, then you should include the year or season in the name.

### Product Type[​](#product-type "Direct link to Product Type")

This is where you can determine if the product is meant to be sold standalone (can be purchase without purchasing anything else), an addon (can only be purchased as part of a league or competition), or both (standalone and addon).

Standalone products will show up on your product listing page.

Addon products can be added to leagues and competitions similar to fees. A typical use of an addon product would be a locker.

### Active[​](#active "Direct link to Active")

If you need to disable a product temporarily you can uncheck the **Active** box. When a product is disabled it cannot be added to leagues, competitions, or products as an addon, and will not be charged to your members for anything it is already associated to. It will also no longer appear on your product listings page.

### Quantity[​](#quantity "Direct link to Quantity")

You can limit the quantity / inventory for a product. This quantity limit is for the lifetime of the product (not seasonal). Once the quantity limit is reached, the product will still show up on your product listings page, but will show as **Sold Out**.

Leave this blank if you don't want to limit the quantity of sales for a product.

### Requiring a Curler Profile[​](#requiring-a-curler-profile "Direct link to Requiring a Curler Profile")

When you require a curler profile you are forcing registrations to be **individual** only.

It's required for the system to apply seasonal membership and affiliate fees, and multiple league discounts. The system needs to know who (curler profile) has paid their fees already for the season so that they aren't charged again in future registrations.

### Seasonal per curler[​](#seasonal-per-curler "Direct link to Seasonal per curler")

If you are requiring a curler profile for the product, then you can also specify, similar to a fee or a league, that this product can only be purchased one per curler per season.

This is handy to minimize errors from curlers who might accidentally try to purchase the same product more than once, and serves the double purpose of limiting purchases of a scarce product.

If your product is something from the pro shop that curler should be able to purchase as many times as they like, you would leave this unchecked. It's unlikely you'd even require a curler profile for products like that.

### Lifetime per curler[​](#lifetime-per-curler "Direct link to Lifetime per curler")

This is for a product that should never be purchased more than once per curler. Usefull if you are selling a lifetime membership or similar product.

Checking this box also means that discounts based on it's purchase can run across multiple seasons.

### Pricing & Tax[​](#pricing--tax "Direct link to Pricing & Tax")

When you set the pricing for your product, we highly recommend breaking out the tax, both for transparency to your members, but also to make it easier for your bookkeeping.

There is a handy tax calculator which will show you what your total with tax will be in case you want to untangle taxes from your existing pricing.

![Tax Calculator](/assets/images/tax-calculator-90b6d6968e3abec4a8f954df3353c928.png)

### Private[​](#private "Direct link to Private")

You can check this box to make a product available **only** to those that have been given a unique URL to click. This is typically used to offer early access to a product for returning members.

If you check this box then once you save the product, a unique URL will be generated for it. You can copy this unique URL and send it to the subset of curlers you want to be able to purchase it. To find this URL simply click on the name of the product on the administrator product listing page.

### Notification email[​](#notification-email "Direct link to Notification email")

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

If you'd like someone to be notified every time the product is purchased you can enter their email address here. You can enter more than one email address separated by commas.

We don't perform any email validations on this field, so please make sure you don't have a typo or a defunct email address or they won't receive the notifications.

We also don't recommend using this feature for fellow managers since they will have access to the same information from within the admin area, and sending notification emails get spammy.

### Summary & Description[​](#summary--description "Direct link to Summary & Description")

When you enter a summary, it will show up on the product listing page when members come to Curling IO.

The description shows up when your members click on the name of the product and also when they fill in required information for it. Keep in mind that member's may just add the product to their cart without clicking on it's name.

### Required Reading[​](#required-reading "Direct link to Required Reading")

You can enter some text that your curlers are guaranteed to see before they can complete their purchase of the product. Just leave this blank to avoid this step.

We recommend you use this sparingly as it adds another step (friction) to product purchases for your users.

## Accounting Codes[​](#accounting-codes "Direct link to Accounting Codes")

If you've enabled accounting in your [Club Settings](/docs/club-management/settings.md#accounting), you'll see an **Accounting Codes** section when creating or editing a product.

Most clubs only use the default account code set in Club Settings. However, you can optionally add Class and Project codes here to differentiate between product categories (e.g., merchandise vs. rentals) or track fundraising campaigns.

**For complete details and examples, see the [Accounting Codes Guide](/docs/accounting/accounting-codes.md).**

## Assigning Fees[​](#assigning-fees "Direct link to Assigning Fees")

All fees that should be added to the cost of the product can be added here. Keep in mind that just creating a fee doesn't not automatically associate it to your product. You need to specify which fees are relevant for each product, as this will almost always vary between products.

![Addons and Fees](/assets/images/addons-and-fees-2494190ac1312c1190926ab2c004294e.png)

Examples of fees are your provincial and national affiliate fees, but also any membership or capital improvement fees you may have at the club.

Please note, that you cannot add fees to a product that has a type of *both* or *addon* since this could cause inception, and we may start questioning whether we exist in *the real!*

[You can find information about fees here.](/docs/club-management/fees.md)

## Adding Custom Fields[​](#adding-custom-fields "Direct link to Adding Custom Fields")

Custom fields allow you to ask your curlers questions specific to your club that we haven't thought of during registration.

Keep in mind that for individual registration where you require a curler profile, you shouldn't need to add custom fields for general curler data as this will already be associated with the registration.

Like fees, keep in mind that custom fields are not automatically added to all of your products. You need to specify which custom fields are relevant for each product, as this will often vary.

## Assigning Discounts[​](#assigning-discounts "Direct link to Assigning Discounts")

You can apply discounts to your products that depend on the registrant meeting specific criteria. Keep in mind that just creating a discount doesn't not automatically associate it to your products. You need to specify which discounts are relevant for each product, as this will almost always vary between products.

## Who Purchased a Product?[​](#who-purchased-a-product "Direct link to Who Purchased a Product?")

You can click the **Purchases** link next to one of your existing products. It will take you to our reports session filtered by the product. This will show you all of the purchases for it.

### Greyed out Fields[​](#greyed-out-fields "Direct link to Greyed out Fields")

The fields that are greyed out are required by the system for various operations like waivers, gender restricted events, and age restricted events / fees / discounts. You cannot change these fields.

### Required[​](#required "Direct link to Required")

If you specify that a field is required, then curlers must fill it out when registering and creating a profile.

### Optional[​](#optional "Direct link to Optional")

If you specify that a field is optional, then curlers will be asked, but may choose not to fill it out when registering and creating a profile.

### Don't Ask[​](#dont-ask "Direct link to Don't Ask")

If you specify that a field is don't ask, then curlers will not be asked to fill it out when registering and creating a curler profile.

### Missing Fields?[​](#missing-fields "Direct link to Missing Fields?")

If there are fields that you need to collect but are missing, then you can [submit a feature request to discuss it on our feedback board](https://curling.canny.io/).

Profile fields shouldn't be specific to just one club. Also, temporal fields like **age** or **first time curler** cannot be asked as part of a curler profile since they wouldn't remain accurate from season to season, but would be fine to ask via custom fields on your events.

# Programs

Programs sit between products and events: they’re purchased like products, but run on specific dates like leagues and competitions. They’re usually seasonal and do not include draw schedules, teams, or game scoring.

Some examples of programs are:

* Learn 2 Curl sessions
* Curling camps
* Training Seminars
* Volunteer events and lists

## Filling in the Form[​](#filling-in-the-form "Direct link to Filling in the Form")

### Name[​](#name "Direct link to Name")

This is the name shown to members. Because programs have start and end dates, the same program name may be reused in future seasons, but many clubs include the season or year in the name for clarity.

### Start & End Dates[​](#start--end-dates "Direct link to Start & End Dates")

When your program runs. These aren’t to be confused with when registration opens and closes.

### Open & Close Dates[​](#open--close-dates "Direct link to Open & Close Dates")

Specify open and close dates to control when members can register or purchase. Before the open date, members will see when registration opens. After the close date, members will see that registration is closed.

### Active[​](#active "Direct link to Active")

If you need to disable a program temporarily you can uncheck the **Active** box. When a program is disabled it cannot be seen or purchased by your members.

### Pricing & Tax[​](#pricing--tax "Direct link to Pricing & Tax")

Set a price and select applicable taxes. A tax calculator shows the calculated tax and total to help with pricing.

![Tax Calculator](/assets/images/tax-calculator-90b6d6968e3abec4a8f954df3353c928.png)

If your program uses per‑curler fees (e.g., membership or affiliate fees), include them as required fees in the [Assigning Fees & Addons](#assigning-fees--addons) section so they’re applied consistently and only once per season per curler.

### Requiring a Curler Profile[​](#requiring-a-curler-profile "Direct link to Requiring a Curler Profile")

Forces registrations to be individual (not team), tying the purchase to a curler. Recommended when you need per‑curler limits, to apply per‑curler fees, or to drive discounts that depend on the registrant.

### Seasonal per curler[​](#seasonal-per-curler "Direct link to Seasonal per curler")

If a curler profile is required, this limits each curler to one registration for the program per season.

### Private[​](#private "Direct link to Private")

Make a program available only via a unique URL. After saving, open the program’s Details view to copy the private URL. Share this link for early access or targeted availability.

### Notification email[​](#notification-email "Direct link to Notification email")

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

This sends an email whenever the program is purchased.

### Spots Available and Waitlists[​](#spots-available-and-waitlists "Direct link to Spots Available and Waitlists")

Set a capacity using Spots Available. When sold out:

* If Waitlist is enabled, members can join the waitlist and you can approve them when space opens up.
* If Waitlist is not enabled, the program shows as Sold Out.

More details and examples can be found in the [waitlists section.](/docs/club-management/waitlists.md)

### Min and Max Age[​](#min-and-max-age "Direct link to Min and Max Age")

If you are requiring a profile (individual registration) then you can restrict the age of members who can register. The age restrictions are inclusive, meaning that entering a min age of "18" will include 18‑year‑olds. Age restrictions use your club's [age calculation configuration](/docs/club-management/settings.md#age-cutoff). By default, ages are calculated as of the day before your season starts (e.g., June 30th if your season starts July 1st). For example, if a curler is not 18 or older based on your club's age calculation date, they will be prevented from registering for a program with a min age of 18.

### Summary & Description[​](#summary--description "Direct link to Summary & Description")

* Summary appears on the program listing page.
* Description shows on the program details page. Keep in mind that members may add the program directly to their cart without opening the details page.

### Required Reading[​](#required-reading "Direct link to Required Reading")

Show important information during checkout that must be acknowledged before purchase. Use sparingly to keep checkout smooth.

### Post registration message[​](#post-registration-message "Direct link to Post registration message")

Optional message shown after purchase on the thank‑you screen and in the receipt email. Use this for reminders or next steps.

### Sponsorship[​](#sponsorship "Direct link to Sponsorship")

Associate a sponsor to show their logo and name on the program page. You can also upload a program image that will be shown publicly.

## Accounting Codes[​](#accounting-codes "Direct link to Accounting Codes")

If you've enabled accounting in your [Club Settings](/docs/club-management/settings.md#accounting), you'll see an **Accounting Codes** section when creating or editing a program.

Most clubs only use the default account code set in Club Settings. However, you can optionally add Class and Project codes here to differentiate between program types (e.g., Learn to Curl vs. training camps) or track grant-funded programs.

**For complete details and examples, see the [Accounting Codes Guide](/docs/accounting/accounting-codes.md).**

## Assigning Fees & Addons[​](#assigning-fees--addons "Direct link to Assigning Fees & Addons")

All fees and addons that should be added to the cost of the program can be added here. Keep in mind that just creating a fee does not automatically associate it to your programs. You need to specify which fees and addons are relevant for each program, as this will almost always vary between offerings. E.g. junior and learn‑to‑curl programs may not have any fees.

![Addons and Fees](/assets/images/addons-and-fees-2494190ac1312c1190926ab2c004294e.png)

Examples of fees are your provincial and national affiliate fees, and any membership or capital improvement fees at the club.

Examples of addons are lockers, grippers, helmets—any product you want to offer as a required or optional addon to the program.

[You can find information about fees here.](/docs/club-management/fees.md)

## Custom Fields[​](#custom-fields "Direct link to Custom Fields")

Ask additional questions during registration using Custom Fields. Mark fields as required when necessary. Ordering is supported.

![Custom Fields](/assets/images/custom-fields-1e316b3353f0fe8ad8b26497a2c2a0ec.png)

## Discounts[​](#discounts "Direct link to Discounts")

Associate discounts that apply when criteria are met (e.g., early‑bird, member, age‑based). Create discounts first, then attach them to the relevant programs.

## Who Registered?[​](#who-registered "Direct link to Who Registered?")

From the Programs list, click Purchased to open the Order Items report filtered to the selected program. This shows all purchases/registrations.

# Item Recommendations

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

Item recommendations help your members discover related leagues, programs, and products during registration. When a member adds an item to their cart and fills in the required information, they'll see suggestions for other items they might be interested in.

For example, if someone registers for a beginner league, you can automatically suggest your beginner clinic program or recommend equipment like a slider or broom.

## How It Works[​](#how-it-works "Direct link to How It Works")

After a member adds an item to their cart and completes the necessary information (like selecting which family member is registering), they'll be shown up to 3 recommended items on a special recommendations page.

From this page, they can:

* View details about each recommended item
* Add any of these items directly to their cart with a single click
* Continue to checkout when they're ready

This makes it easy for members to discover programs and products they might not have known about, and helps you increase registration and sales.

## Setting Up Recommendations[​](#setting-up-recommendations "Direct link to Setting Up Recommendations")

To enable recommendations for your leagues, programs, or products, you'll add **Recommendation Keywords** when creating or editing the item.

### Adding Recommendation Keywords[​](#adding-recommendation-keywords "Direct link to Adding Recommendation Keywords")

1. When creating or editing a league, program, or product, look for the **Recommendation Keywords** field in the registration section
2. Enter keywords that describe the item, separated by commas
3. Choose keywords that reflect the type, skill level, or audience for the item

**Examples:**

* For a beginner league: `beginner, social, recreational`
* For a competitive league: `competitive, advanced, experienced`
* For a junior program: `junior, youth, kids, beginner`
* For a broom in your pro shop: `equipment, beginner, supplies`
* For a club social event: `social, fun, entertainment`

### Best Practices for Keywords[​](#best-practices-for-keywords "Direct link to Best Practices for Keywords")

* **Be descriptive**: Use words that clearly describe what the item is about
* **Be consistent**: Use the same keywords across similar items so they recommend each other
* **Think like a member**: What words would someone use to describe this item?
* **Use 3-5 keywords**: You don't need many—focus on the most relevant ones
* **Mix categories**: Include skill level (beginner, advanced), type (social, competitive), and audience (youth, adult) as appropriate

### Example: Multi-Session Leagues[​](#example-multi-session-leagues "Direct link to Example: Multi-Session Leagues")

Many clubs split their leagues into multiple sessions throughout the year (Fall, Winter, Spring). Recommendations are perfect for encouraging members to register for additional sessions.

**Scenario:** You have three sessions of the same league:

* Monday Night Open - Fall
* Monday Night Open - Winter
* Monday Night Open - Spring

**Setup:** Give all three leagues the same keywords: `monday, open`

**Result:** When a member registers for the Fall session and completes their registration information, they'll see recommendations for the Winter and Spring sessions. This makes it easy for them to sign up for multiple sessions at once, increasing retention throughout your season.

This same approach works for:

* Day vs. evening sessions of the same league type
* Different skill levels on the same night (Monday Beginner, Monday Intermediate, Monday Advanced)
* Related programs running in different time blocks

## How Recommendations Are Selected[​](#how-recommendations-are-selected "Direct link to How Recommendations Are Selected")

When your members see recommendations, the system looks for other active items that:

* Share similar keywords with what they just added
* Are available for registration (not closed or full)
* Match eligibility requirements (age, gender) if applicable
* They haven't already registered for

Items with more matching keywords will appear first in the recommendations.

## When Recommendations Appear[​](#when-recommendations-appear "Direct link to When Recommendations Appear")

Recommendations will only appear when:

* The item being added has recommendation keywords set up
* There are other eligible items with matching keywords
* The member hasn't seen recommendations for this item before

If a member edits an item in their cart that previously showed recommendations, they won't see them again—this prevents interrupting their checkout experience.

## Items Without Keywords[​](#items-without-keywords "Direct link to Items Without Keywords")

If you don't add recommendation keywords to an item:

* It won't trigger recommendations when someone registers for it
* It won't appear as a recommendation for other items
* It will work normally in all other ways

This gives you complete control over which items participate in the recommendation system.

## Tips for Success[​](#tips-for-success "Direct link to Tips for Success")

**Start with your most popular items**: Add keywords to your busiest leagues and programs first, then expand from there.

**Cross-promote thoughtfully**: If you have a beginner league and a beginner skills clinic, use matching keywords so they recommend each other.

**Don't forget products**: Add keywords to pro shop items like equipment, apparel, and supplies so they can be recommended alongside leagues and programs.

**Review and adjust**: After a few weeks, see which items are frequently added together and refine your keywords to improve recommendations.

**Keep it simple**: You don't need a complex keyword strategy—start with obvious descriptors like skill level and type of activity.

# Registration and Results Widget

Curling IO provides two widgets you can use to embed your leagues, competitions, and product data on your website.

* The registration and results widget shows your leagues, competitions, and products, along with their schedules, results, and registration links. You would typically embed this widget on it's own dedicated page on your website.
* The current games widget shows the list of games that have just finished, are currently being played, or are starting soon. You would typically embed this widget in a small square on your home page.

## Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

To proceed, first you'll need to know how to edit an HTML file so you can copy and paste the necessary code in to your website.

The full instructions to embed the widgets can be found here: <https://github.com/pairshaped/curlingio-results/tree/master#readme>

We've also provided sample HTML files you can use as a reference to embed the registration and results widget and the current games widget.

* [Registration and Results Example HTML with Instructions](https://github.com/pairshaped/curlingio-results/blob/master/example.html#L13-L54)

* [Current Games Example HTML with Instructions](https://github.com/pairshaped/curlingio-results/blob/master/current-games-example.html#L13-L36)

You can save these HTML files locally, open them in a browser, and make tweaks to the source to test out changes if you like. Then, once your happy with it, take the result and embed them into your website wherever you like.

[Full installation instructions can be found in the README on Github](https://github.com/pairshaped/curlingio-results)

This page consolidates all club configuration including general settings, payments & accounting, navigation & branding (website hosting), and contact information. Mailchimp configuration has moved—see the [Integrations guide](/docs/club-management/integrations.md) for the new workflow.

The sections below cover the main areas of the Club → Settings page.

## General[​](#general "Direct link to General")

This section includes your club's basic information and identity settings.

### Club Name and Languages[​](#club-name-and-languages "Direct link to Club Name and Languages")

* **Name** — Controls the header text and the default club name shown publicly.
* **English supported** and **French supported** — Enable these checkboxes to determine which language toggles appear to your curlers and which content fields you can complete in the admin screens. When both are enabled, curlers can switch languages on the fly.

### Branding[​](#branding "Direct link to Branding")

* **Logo** and **Nav logo** — Upload full-size and compact versions for the header and navigation bar.

### Season Start[​](#season-start "Direct link to Season Start")

You can select the month that you'd like your season to begin. It's always going to be the 1st of this month (at 12:00 AM). This date should occur **before you start taking registrations** for the current season. This cutoff affects the following:

1. Your seasonal fees and seasonal products. This determines which season they are collected for during registration.
2. Your leagues based on their start dates.
3. Seasonal filters where you can select a season (like at the top of your public leagues screen).

**Be careful changing this since the effects are so wide reaching and we cannot retroactively fix your orders.** You should rarely, if ever, need to change this month more than once.

**Note:** Age restrictions are now configured separately using the Age Calculation setting below, allowing you to decouple age calculations from your season start date if needed.

### Age Calculation[​](#age-cutoff "Direct link to Age Calculation")

This setting controls how ages are calculated for age restrictions on events, programs, fees, and discounts. **Note:** Waivers always use the curler's age at the time of registration and are not affected by this setting.

You have three options:

#### Before season begins (Default)[​](#before-season-begins-default "Direct link to Before season begins (Default)")

Ages are calculated as of the day before your season starts. For example, if your season starts July 1st, ages are calculated as of June 30th.

**When to use:** This is the simplest option and works well for most clubs. Ages remain consistent throughout the season.

**Example:** If your season starts <!-- -->July<!-- --> <!-- -->1<!-- -->, <!-- -->2026<!-- -->, and you have a league with a maximum age of 17:

* Ages are calculated as of
  <!-- -->
  June
  <!-- -->
  <!-- -->
  30
  <!-- -->
  ,
  <!-- -->
  2026
  <!-- -->
  (the day before season starts)
* A curler born

  <!-- -->

  <!-- -->
  ,
  <!-- -->
  2026
  <!-- -->
  (eligible)
* A curler born
  <!-- -->
  June

  <!-- -->

  <!-- -->
  ,
  <!-- -->
  2008
  <!-- -->
  would be 18 on
  <!-- -->
  June
  <!-- -->
  <!-- -->
  30
  <!-- -->
  ,
  <!-- -->
  2026
  <!-- -->
  (not eligible)

#### Custom cutoff month[​](#custom-cutoff-month "Direct link to Custom cutoff month")

Ages are calculated as of the last day of the month before your selected cutoff month. The cutoff month is always chronologically equal to or after your season start month.

**When to use:** When you want to align with age categories used by other organizations (e.g., Curl BC uses December 31).

**How it works:** The cutoff month is always equal to or after your season start. If you select January as your cutoff month and your season starts in July, the system uses January of the same season year (<!-- -->2027<!-- -->), and calculates ages as of the day before that month begins (December 31st). If you select September as your cutoff month and your season starts in July, ages are calculated as of August 31st.

**Example 1 - December 31st cutoff (like Curl BC):** Season starts <!-- -->July<!-- --> <!-- -->1<!-- -->, <!-- -->2026<!-- -->, with cutoff month set to January (results in <!-- -->December<!-- --> <!-- -->31<!-- -->, <!-- -->2026<!-- --> cutoff date). A league with max age of 17:

* Ages are calculated as of
  <!-- -->
  December
  <!-- -->
  <!-- -->
  31
  <!-- -->
  ,
  <!-- -->
  2026
* A curler born

  <!-- -->

  <!-- -->
  <!-- -->

  <!-- -->
  ,
  <!-- -->
  2026
  <!-- -->
  (not eligible)

**Example 2 - August 31st cutoff:** Season starts <!-- -->July<!-- --> <!-- -->1<!-- -->, <!-- -->2026<!-- -->, with cutoff month set to September (results in <!-- -->August<!-- --> <!-- -->31<!-- -->, <!-- -->2026<!-- --> cutoff date). A program with min age of 18:

#### Registration date[​](#registration-date "Direct link to Registration date")

Ages are calculated based on when the curler registers.

**When to use:** When you have "must be 18 to register" type requirements where the registration date matters, or programs that run throughout the year where current age is more relevant than a fixed cutoff.

**Example:** For an event with min age of 18:

* Person A born
  <!-- -->
  September
  <!-- -->
  <!-- -->
  15
  <!-- -->
  ,
  <!-- -->
  2008
  <!-- -->
  registers on
  <!-- -->
  September
  <!-- -->
  <!-- -->
  14
  <!-- -->
  ,
  <!-- -->
  2026
  <!-- -->
  → Age 17 (not eligible)
* Person A registers on
  <!-- -->
  September
  <!-- -->
  <!-- -->
  15
  <!-- -->
  ,
  <!-- -->
  2026
  <!-- -->
  → Age 18 (eligible)
* Person B born
  <!-- -->
  November
  <!-- -->
  <!-- -->
  20
  <!-- -->
  ,
  <!-- -->
  2008
  <!-- -->
  registers on
  <!-- -->
  September
  <!-- -->
  <!-- -->
  15
  <!-- -->
  ,
  <!-- -->
  2026
  <!-- -->
  → Age 17 (not eligible)
* Person B registers on
  <!-- -->
  November
  <!-- -->
  <!-- -->
  20
  <!-- -->
  ,
  <!-- -->
  2026
  <!-- -->
  → Age 18 (eligible)

**Note:** Different curlers may have different ages for the same event based on when they registered.

### Sheet Configuration[​](#sheet-configuration "Direct link to Sheet Configuration")

The remaining ice-sheet fields let you control how sheets appear when creating draws or scheduling events:

* **Sheets** — Total number of sheets at your club.
* **Sheet prefix** — Text prefixed to each sheet number (e.g., "Sheet" results in "Sheet 1").
* **Sheet ordering** — Choose ascending or descending naming.
* **Show sheets** — Toggle whether sheet assignments display publicly.

### Widget URL[​](#widget-url "Direct link to Widget URL")

The Widget URL gives you an embeddable link you can drop into an external website. It points to your Curling IO-hosted registration widget so members can register without navigating away from your main site.

## Payments & Accounting[​](#payments--accounting "Direct link to Payments & Accounting")

This section controls payment methods, fees, and accounting integration.

### Payment Options[​](#payment-options "Direct link to Payment Options")

These settings determine how curlers can complete checkout for club products.

* **Can be paid online** — Allow credit card payments. (Ignored until your club is connected to our payment processor.)
* **Can be paid offline** — Allow offline methods (cash, cheque, etc.).
* **Accept partial payments** — Let curlers submit a deposit rather than the full balance.

### Convenience fee / Surcharge[​](#convenience-fee--surcharge "Direct link to Convenience fee / Surcharge")

A convenience fee or surcharge can be added to your orders automatically. You can specify its label (shown to your members), how it will be applied (online, offline, etc.), a percentage amount, and a fixed amount (percent and fixed are combined).

When a convenience fee is added to a member's cart specific to one payment method (online or offline), Curling IO will display a notice at the top of the cart alerting the member to its addition as well as showing the fee in the cart and total.

This convenience fee is never taxed or discounted, and is always automatically calculated based on your percentage (of the order total) and fixed amount.

**Curling IO is not responsible for fees or surcharges that you incorrectly choose to implement. Make sure your use is compliant with potential laws in your region.**

**You may not apply a convenience fee for online payments that exceeds a total of $3.30 on a $100 payment if you are also accepting offline payments. Anything higher than this potentially ends up being too punishing and lowering online payment volume significantly enough that it costs Curling IO to provide an online payment option to your club. If you absolutely MUST have a higher convenience fee, then we'll need to arrange for you to cover the $5.00 month fee we have to pay to enable your online payments. We will be enforcing this rule for the 2026/2027 season.**

It is your responsibility, before adding a convenience fee / surcharge, to make sure you understand the implications and whether or not this is legal in your jurisdiction. For example:

* There's a limit to the amount you can surcharge to cover credit card processing fees.
* In the province of Quebec you are currently not allowed to pass along credit card processing fees to the consumer.
* There's a difference between a convenience fee and a surcharge, so make sure you use a label that reflects what you are charging.
* You may be required to offer a non-surcharge option if you choose to implement one for online payments.

Please review the relevant laws in your region regarding surcharges and convenience fees. Here are some Canada specific links:

* <https://www.canada.ca/en/financial-consumer-agency/services/merchants/credit-fees-merchant.html>
* <https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/publications/gi-200/application-gst-hst-credit-card-surcharges.html>

Note: Fees you implement should never reflect on the Curling IO platform, therefore we are restricting certain words in the convenience fee's label and may add further restrictions in the future if necessary.

### Accounting[​](#accounting "Direct link to Accounting")

Accounting features allow you to categorize revenue items and track financial transactions for integration with accounting software like QuickBooks, Xero, or Sage.

Check the checkbox to enable accounting for your club. Once enabled, you can set default account codes for each type of registration (Leagues, Bonspiels, Programs, Products, Fees, Venues).

Most clubs either don't need accounting codes at all, or simply set up these default codes and never touch individual items. Advanced users can add more detailed tracking codes (Class and Project codes) at the item level for tracking by demographics, departments, or grant funding.

**For complete details on how to use accounting codes, see the [Accounting Codes Guide](/docs/accounting/accounting-codes.md). For more information on double-entry bookkeeping and accrual accounting, see the [Accounting Transactions Guide](/docs/accounting/accounting-transactions.md).**

## Navigation and Branding[​](#navigation-and-branding "Direct link to Navigation and Branding")

This section controls the visual appearance and navigation structure of your public website.

### Brand Palette[​](#brand-palette "Direct link to Brand Palette")

* **Brand palette** — Pick a palette preset and fine-tune individual colours (Primary, Secondary, Success, Info, Warning, Danger, Light, Dark) by entering hex codes.

### Navigation and Layout[​](#navigation-and-layout "Direct link to Navigation and Layout")

* **Calendar enabled?** — Toggle the public calendar tab. When enabled, visitors can browse draws, rentals (Premium), and closures.
* **Calendar default view** — Select the view you want to load first (Month, Week, or Day). Clubs with rentals often prefer the day view.
* **Landing page** — Choose where visitors land first (Landing Page, Leagues, Bonspiels, Programs, Products, Calendar, etc.).
* **Program label** and **Competition label** — Rename these tabs to match local terminology.
* **Banner** and **Banner visibility** — Upload a 1200 × 250 banner image and choose which screens display it.
* **Sidebar options** — Decide which touts appear on hosted pages (Current games, Random sponsor, Latest news).
* **Section summaries** — Provide English and French blurbs for Leagues, Bonspiels, Programs, Products, and the Calendar. These appear below public section headers and on Landing Page cards.

### Tags[​](#tags "Direct link to Tags")

Tags are used to make it easier for your curlers to search a large number of leagues and competitions. We don't recommend using tags unless you have multiple pages worth of leagues or competitions that curlers must search through.

## Contact Information[​](#contact-information "Direct link to Contact Information")

This section manages all contact details and links shown on your public website.

* **Address block** — Street, unit, mailing address, city, province/state, country, postal/ZIP code, and time zone (used for draw schedules and emails).
* **Primary contact** — Phone number and email shown on the contact page.
* **Site & policy links** — Website URL, Terms URL, Privacy URL.
* **Social & media handles** — Facebook, X (Twitter), Instagram, TikTok, YouTube.
* **Community invites** — Optional invitation links for WhatsApp, Slack, and Discord; shared with members on receipts and the contact page.
* **Club contacts** — Add individual contacts (name, email, phone) to spotlight specific volunteers or board members.

# Sponsors

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

You can create reusable sponsors that can be associated with leagues, competitions, products, pages, and articles.

When a member views the details of any of these items, the sponsor logo will be shown along with it's name.

Curling IO will keep track of how many times a sponsor has been viewed and how many times it has been clicked (if a URL has been provided).

## Finding Sponsors[​](#finding-sponsors "Direct link to Finding Sponsors")

Within your admin area, click on the **Club** dropdown menu in the top bar and then click on **Sponsors**.

To update an existing sponsor, click the **Edit** link next to it.

## Fields[​](#fields "Direct link to Fields")

### Name[​](#name "Direct link to Name")

The name is required and will be shown below the sponsor logo / image. For example: "Brought to you by ACME Inc."

### Logo[​](#logo "Direct link to Logo")

The logo is required and will be shown on the detail page of any leagues, competitions, products, pages, or articles that use the sponsor.

### URL[​](#url "Direct link to URL")

The URL is optional. If a URL is provided, when a member clicks the sponsor logo they will be sent to the URL provided. Curling IO will track how many times a sponsor has been clicked.

### Active[​](#active "Direct link to Active")

You can temporarily disable a sponsor logo by deactivating it. You can still associate a deactivated sponsor to leagues, competitions, products, pages, and articles, but it will no longer be shown to your members.

## Deleting Sponsors[​](#deleting-sponsors "Direct link to Deleting Sponsors")

To remove a sponsor, click the **Delete** link next to it. This will also remove it from any of it's associations.

## Troubleshooting[​](#troubleshooting "Direct link to Troubleshooting")

We noticed after launching this sponsors feature that a popular browser extension called "uBlock Origin" may hide the sponsor logo upload (preventing you from creating a sponsor). If you are experiencing this issue, we highly recommend disabling the extension for Curling IO. We don't embed any thiird party advertising within Curling IO anyways, so ad block extensions like uBlock provide no benefits on our site.

# Support

You can submit supports requests from within Curling IO. Support requests submitted any other way may be missed or at a minimum will take longer for a response.

It's important to differentiate between support requests and feature requests. Do not submit feature requests here, instead please use our [feedback board](https://curling.canny.io/clubs) where you can not only post your request but also find and vote on other feature requests.

Please keep in mind that support has a cost (to us). We made a choice early on, that in order to keep costs and fees to a minimum, our clubs would need to self-support as much as possible. To this end, we have provided tutorial videos and documentation covering all of our features, which you can find in the left navigation area. Most other platforms have yearly fees to cover their support costs, while we allow clubs to operate free of charge. If you are not comfortable self-supporting, and need more hands-on guidance, we do offer [paid support options](https://premium.curling.io/en/products).

# Waitlists

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

With Curling IO you can take in waitlist registrations once a league, competition, or product has been sold out.

## Enabling Waitlists[​](#enabling-waitlists "Direct link to Enabling Waitlists")

When you are creating / editing a league, competition, or product you will have the option of enabling a "Waitlist" for it.

![Waitlist Enabled](/assets/images/waitlist-enabled-5dac6985fe9f9c01d5810a4ec4d83e68.png)

Waitlists work in conjunction with inventory, which is the number of spots available for a league / competition, or quantity for a product. Once the inventory has been exhausted your members will be able to register for the waitlist (if enabled). You can even set the number of spots / quantity to 0 to limit registrations to waitlisting only.

Member's will see a "Waitlist" option for any leagues, competitions, or products that have this feature enabled and are sold out.

![Add me to the waitlist](/assets/images/add-me-to-the-waitlist-c3a840e54c2ea24c32ade80e3555fede.png)

In order to register for a waitlist, the member must first be logged in. They must provide a name, and optionally may provide a phone number and notes for club staff. They are not required to have or assign a curler profile for waitlist registrations.

Once the member has submitted the waitlist registration they will be taken to a screen listing all of their outstanding waitlist registrations. They will also receive an email confirming that they were added to the waitlist.

Member's can only submit multiple waitlist registrations per specific league, competition, or product as long as a different name is used. For example, they can register themself and their children for the same league's waitlist.

## Waitlist Approval[​](#waitlist-approval "Direct link to Waitlist Approval")

Club staff can view a list of waitlist registration for a specific league, competition, or product. There will be a new "Waitlist" tab when enabled.

Once a member has been approved, they can register for the waitlisted league, competition, or product, ignoring that the inventory (spots / quantity) has been exhausted. Upon registration the waitlist registration is considered "claimed".

![Approved Waitlists](/assets/images/approved-waitlists-3d5f0f119bb96290658e3401427a854f.png)

### Important: Waitlist Approvals Grant Exactly One Extra Slot[​](#important-waitlist-approvals-grant-exactly-one-extra-slot "Direct link to Important: Waitlist Approvals Grant Exactly One Extra Slot")

**One approval = one registration.** When you approve a waitlist entry, the member receives permission to register for exactly one spot, even if the event is sold out. This prevents overselling and ensures fair allocation.

#### How It Works[​](#how-it-works "Direct link to How It Works")

* A member with an approved waitlist entry can add exactly **one** of that item to their cart
* If they attempt to add multiple quantities, the system automatically removes excess items at checkout
* They'll see an error message: "Some items in your cart exceeded available inventory and were adjusted"
* This protection maintains accurate capacity limits

#### Example[​](#example "Direct link to Example")

Your league has 20 spots and is currently full (20/20):

1. You approve a member from the waitlist
2. That member can now register, becoming the 21st participant
3. If they try to add 2 registrations to their cart, the system automatically reduces it to 1
4. The capacity stays at 21/20 (one approved waitlist member)

#### Why This Matters[​](#why-this-matters "Direct link to Why This Matters")

* **Fair allocation**: Each approval grants one opportunity, ensuring equity among waitlisted members
* **Accurate capacity**: Prevents a single approval from being used for unlimited registrations
* **Prevents abuse**: Members cannot exploit their approval to register multiple times

\*\* IMPORTANT: Waitlists are tied to an account, so members MUST login with the same account (email address) to access their waitlist.

If you approve a waitlisted member and they report that they are unable to register, please verify that they logged in with the same email address.

## Waitlist Cancellation[​](#waitlist-cancellation "Direct link to Waitlist Cancellation")

Club staff, and the registering member, can cancel (remove) a waitlist registration at any time before it is claimed.

The member is sent an email notifying them of cancellation.

# Waivers

Curling IO allows you to collect legal agreements, liability releases, photo consents, and other acknowledgments from your curlers during registration. The waiver system supports both **required** waivers (where users must type acceptance text to continue) and **optional** waivers (where users can choose to accept or reject).

By default, Curling IO includes waivers from Curling Canada's Business of Curling program intended for curling clubs. These are asked once per season per curler during registration.

We keep a snapshot of each waiver that was responded to for future reference. These snapshots, along with acceptance and rejection data, can be found in the [Reports section](/docs/accounting/reports.md).

You can customize or replace these waivers with your own text, or deactivate them if you'd rather manage the waiver process in person at the club.

**Registration Friction Considerations:**

* **Required waivers** (like liability releases) require typing acceptance text and must be completed to continue registration
* **Optional waivers** (like photo consent) use simple Accept/Reject buttons and don't block registration, reducing friction while still tracking member preferences

Waivers are specific to your club and are collected once per season per curler when a curler is first registering. They are not event specific.

## Editing Waivers[​](#editing-waivers "Direct link to Editing Waivers")

You can find your waivers within the admin area. Click on the **Club** dropdown menu in the top bar and then click on **Waivers**.

When done, click the "Update Waiver" button and your changes will be saved.

![Customize Waivers](/assets/images/customize-73d30712c3da7c33a07b95252aca385e.png)

### Name[​](#name "Direct link to Name")

This is the name of your waiver. This won't show up in the actual waiver, but it will identify which waivers have been accepted when curlers view their profiles. Please try to stick to one short word to identify the waiver.

### Acceptance[​](#acceptance "Direct link to Acceptance")

This is the exact text users must type to accept a **required** waiver. By default this is "I agree" for adult (over the age of majority), and "We agree" for youth (under the age of majority) waivers.

For **optional** waivers (see Optional Acceptance below), this field can be left blank as users will click Accept/Reject buttons instead of typing text.

**Tip:** Keep acceptance text short and simple. Users must type it exactly as shown, including capitalization.

### Min and Max Age[​](#min-and-max-age "Direct link to Min and Max Age")

You can change your age of majority cutoff by editing the min age and max age. These are inclusive, so a min age of 18 will include 18 year olds and a max age of 17 will include 17 years olds.

### Optional Acceptance[​](#optional-acceptance "Direct link to Optional Acceptance")

This checkbox controls whether the waiver is **required** (users must accept to continue) or **optional** (users can accept or reject).

* **Checked:** Users see Accept/Reject buttons and can choose either option. Both choices are recorded. Registration continues regardless of their choice.
* **Unchecked (default):** Users must type the acceptance text to continue. Registration is blocked until they accept.

**When to Use Optional Acceptance:**

* Photo/video consent
* Marketing communications opt-in
* Newsletter subscriptions
* Social media promotion consent
* Non-essential agreements

**When to Use Required Acceptance:**

* Liability waivers
* Code of conduct agreements
* Safety acknowledgments
* Legal releases
* Essential terms and conditions

### Active[​](#active "Direct link to Active")

You can then choose whether or not the waiver is enabled by checking the **Active** checkbox. The default waivers are active by when your Curling IO instance is created.

## Member Experience[​](#member-experience "Direct link to Member Experience")

### Required Waivers[​](#required-waivers "Direct link to Required Waivers")

When a member encounters a **required** waiver during registration:

1. They see the waiver content displayed prominently
2. A text input field asks them to type the acceptance text (e.g., "I agree")
3. They must type the exact text to continue
4. Registration is blocked until they accept

### Optional Waivers[​](#optional-waivers "Direct link to Optional Waivers")

When a member encounters an **optional** waiver during registration:

1. They see an info banner explaining the waiver is optional
2. The waiver content is displayed prominently
3. Two large buttons appear: **Accept** (green) and **Reject** (gray)
4. They can choose either option to continue
5. Both acceptance and rejection are recorded

### Changing Waiver Responses[​](#changing-waiver-responses "Direct link to Changing Waiver Responses")

Members can view their waiver responses from their profile page (Account → Curlers):

**Accepted Waivers:**

* Shown as regular clickable links
* Clicking opens the waiver in a printable view

**Rejected Waivers:**

* Shown as clickable links in **red text**
* Clicking allows them to review and change their response to accepted
* Members cannot change from accepted to rejected

### Body text[​](#body-text "Direct link to Body text")

To customize the content of your waiver, just edit the **Body Text** of the waiver. We use a popular format named **markdown** for text editing. Markdown allows you to add basic formatting to text. You can also use HTML to format the body text. [You can find more information on Markdown here.](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

## Best Practices[​](#best-practices "Direct link to Best Practices")

### Writing Effective Waiver Content[​](#writing-effective-waiver-content "Direct link to Writing Effective Waiver Content")

1. **Use Clear, Plain Language**: Avoid legal jargon when possible
2. **Break Up Long Text**: Use headings, bullet points, and short paragraphs
3. **Highlight Important Terms**: Use **bold** for critical information
4. **Number Key Points**: Makes content easier to reference and understand

### Choosing Required vs Optional[​](#choosing-required-vs-optional "Direct link to Choosing Required vs Optional")

**Use Required for:**

* Legal liability releases
* Safety acknowledgments that protect the club
* Code of conduct agreements
* Essential terms and conditions

**Use Optional for:**

* Photo/video consent
* Marketing communications
* Newsletter subscriptions
* Non-essential programs or features

**Tip:** Optional waivers reduce registration friction while still tracking member preferences. Use them for consents that shouldn't block participation.

### Age-Based Waivers[​](#age-based-waivers "Direct link to Age-Based Waivers")

* Create separate waivers for minors (often requiring parent/guardian signature)
* Use "We agree" for minor waivers (implies parent/guardian consent)
* Use "I agree" for adult waivers (personal consent)
* Always test with sample members of different ages

### Reporting and Compliance[​](#reporting-and-compliance "Direct link to Reporting and Compliance")

The [Waiver Reports](/docs/accounting/reports.md) show both acceptances and rejections:

* **Accepted** column displays "Yes" for accepted, "No" for rejected
* Export waiver data regularly for backup and compliance purposes
* Both required and optional waivers track responses for record-keeping

# Website Hosting

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

Need a modern club website but tired of paying for WordPress, Wix, or Squarespace? Curling IO Hosting gives every club a polished web presence at no extra cost, fully integrated with the rest of the platform.

Configure your site's branding, palette, and contact details in **Club → Settings** (see the [Club Settings guide](/docs/club-management/settings.md) for details), then manage your content in the **Website** section. Changes publish the moment you save:

* A customizable landing page activates the instant you enable it, giving visitors a polished overview without extra work.
* Pages and articles you add appear instantly, and the public site automatically surfaces Pages or News menus when content is available.
* A club-wide customizable colour palette (including call-to-action buttons).
* Member-only visibility controls, letting you lock sensitive announcements or resources to active curlers in a couple of clicks.
* Tight integration with registrations, leagues, bonspiels, programs, and products—no copy-pasting data between systems.
* Performance tuned with the rest of Curling IO, so your website is faster than other hosting options.

Because it is built into Curling IO, the hosting experience stays simple, secure, and easy for volunteers to maintain. Explore the live demo club at <https://demo.curling.io/> to see the layout, navigation, and content options you can launch right away.

## Landing Page[​](#landing-page "Direct link to Landing Page")

The landing page is an optional hero-style layout that opens your site with key calls to action. Enable it from the **Website → Landing Page** settings to swap it in immediately, then fine-tune the content inline.

![Curling IO landing page layout](/img/docs/club-management/website-hosting/landing_page.png)

Editable blocks cover the entire experience:

* **Hero**: Title, tagline, and rich media (YouTube video or uploaded image) to welcome visitors.
* **At a Glance**: Bullet points that summarize hours, amenities, or quick facts.
* **About Our Club**: Short narrative with an optional supporting image.
* **Sections**: Summaries for Leagues, Bonspiels, Programs, Products, and the Calendar—each links directly to its catalog. Those blurbs also appear below the matching section headers.
* **Quick Links**: Buttons that take visitors to common tasks such as membership, bookings, or volunteer sign-up.
* **Testimonials**: Social proof from members or guests.
* **News**: Pulls the three most recent articles to keep the page fresh.
* **Sponsors**: Displays partner logos in a clean carousel with a sponsorship call-to-action.

You can edit copy in place—click the Edit link for any section to update the content and see changes instantly.

![Inline landing page editing](/img/docs/club-management/website-hosting/in_place_editing.png)

## Pages[​](#pages "Direct link to Pages")

Each page has a title, display order, published/draft toggle, optional image, and body content.

You can *restrict* individual pages so that they can only be seen by members. You can also require a specific product or fee purchase before the page becomes visible. By default, pages are unrestricted.

Similar to event and product descriptions, the body content of your page is entered using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) or HTML.

## Articles / News[​](#articles--news "Direct link to Articles / News")

Each article includes a title, publish date, optional image, and body content. The order in which articles appear is based on the published date (most recent first).

You can *restrict* individual articles so that they can only be seen by members. You can also require a specific product or fee purchase before an article is visible. By default, articles are unrestricted.

Similar to event and product descriptions, the body content of your article is entered using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) or HTML.

## Banner[​](#banner "Direct link to Banner")

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

You can upload a banner image that will be shown along the top of your public site. Aim for dimensions near 1200 x 250 pixels; other sizes are resized automatically when uploaded.

You can also choose whether it shows up only on the Pages and Articles sections or across the entire site. We recommend against displaying it everywhere because it takes up a significant amount of screen space.

## Sidebar[​](#sidebar "Direct link to Sidebar")

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

The sidebar is where you can "tout" other content on the right side of the Pages and Articles screens.

You can select which touts should appear in the sidebar for pages and articles.

You can also enable or disable the sidebar for individual pages and articles.

Touts are 300-pixel-wide rectangles.

### Current Games Tout[​](#current-games-tout "Direct link to Current Games Tout")

This tout will show the status and scores of any active, soon-to-be-active, or recently completed games in any leagues or competitions at your club.

### Random Sponsor Tout[​](#random-sponsor-tout "Direct link to Random Sponsor Tout")

This tout will show a random [sponsor from your list of sponsors](/docs/club-management/sponsors.md) if you have any.

### Latest News Tout[​](#latest-news-tout "Direct link to Latest News Tout")

This tout will show a brief summary or image of the most recent news article if you have any.

## SEO (Search Engine Optimization)[​](#seo-search-engine-optimization "Direct link to SEO (Search Engine Optimization)")

Any pages and articles you create will be published in your sitemap.xml (used by search engines like Google) and have appropriate meta tags and titles for better search indexing and discoverability on the web.

## DNS Redirect[​](#dns-redirect "Direct link to DNS Redirect")

If you already own a custom domain, configure your registrar to redirect it to your Curling IO subdomain (for example, `your-curling-club.com` → `your-curling-club.curling.io`).

* [Cloudflare: Redirect all traffic from one domain to another](https://developers.cloudflare.com/redirects/how-to/redirect-all/)
* [Namecheap: Set up URL redirect](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/385/10/how-to-set-up-url-redirect/)
* [GoDaddy: Forward my domain](https://www.godaddy.com/en-ca/help/forward-my-domain-12123)
* [Register.com: Domain forwarding instructions](https://www.register.com/how-to/domain-forwarding)
* [Squarespace (Google Domains): Redirecting a domain](https://support.squarespace.com/hc/en-us/articles/205812378-Redirecting-a-domain)

## Getting Help Setting It Up[​](#getting-help-setting-it-up "Direct link to Getting Help Setting It Up")

If you want a second set of eyes before you launch, our support team is happy to walk through the setup with you.

* Open `Club → Support` in Curling IO and submit a ticket using the *Website* category. The [Support guide](/docs/club-management/support.md) has the full ticket walkthrough if you need a refresher.

* Gather answers to these questions ahead of time—we need them to help you (mark "not applicable" only if you do not have an existing site):

  * Do you already have a website live, and what is the URL?
  * Is it built on a platform like WordPress, Wix, or another site builder?
  * Who currently hosts it (managed service, local provider, etc.)?
  * Do you retain admin access to the existing website?
  * Do you have a domain name registered and access to the registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)?

Once we have these details, we will suggest next steps, share any recommended configurations, and coordinate a quick call if a live walkthrough would help.

# Bracket Templates

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

Bracket templates allow you, the curling club manager, to pre-create playoff brackets that you will re-use between multiple leagues and competitions year after year.

You can copy these templates as a starting point or create your own from scratch.

When you create a playoff bracket for one of your leagues or competitions, Curling IO will present you with your bracket templates, if you have any, and ask you to select which one you would like to use. However, you can always choose to create a bracket from scratch. When using a template, the groups, games (including names), and connections will be copied.

# Profiles

The profiles screen for an event will list all of the profiles who registered for the event. From here you can add curlers who didn't register for the event, as long as they have a profile and have been associated with your club (accepted a waiver or registered). For example, profiles who opted to spare for the event.

To get to the profiles screen, first click on the name of a league of competition.

![Events List](/assets/images/events-d18b109ded429fddd604c714df19b8be.png)

You should then see a list of tabs near the top. Click on the **Profiles** tab.

![Profiles Navigation](/assets/images/navigation-51df4883e97ae67beb701adfe1cd86e9.png)

Some scenarios where you might want to add profiles who didn't register for en event:

1. It was a team registration and you want to add all of the profiles that were mentioned in each team's lineup.
2. The member opted to spare for the event and you'd like to place them on a team.
3. The member was exempt from registration for some other reason and you'd like to place them on a team.

When you click the **Add curlers** button you will be taken to a screen listing all of the profiles in your club who have not already been added (or registered for) the event.

You can search to find the profile(s) you want to add, then simply click the **Add** button next to the profile(s).

When you're done, click the **Back** button to verify the added profiles are now showing up for your event.

## Membership Association Competitions[​](#membership-association-competitions "Direct link to Membership Association Competitions")

Membership associations typically accept team registrations for their competitions but also require curlers to join with their profile so they can be placed on a team and agree to the waiver(s).

Here's the typical flow for a competition:

1. A team representative (coach, skip, or club manager) registers and potentially pays for the team while filling in the team lineup.
2. A message is shown to the representative upon completing the registration, providing instructions to get individual team members registered with a "join link" (these instructions are also included in the follow up email).
3. The team representative shares the "join link" with all of the individual team members.
4. Each team member clicks the "join link" and is prompted to select or create a profile if they don't already have one, or select one if they do.
5. Once they have a profile, they are asked to agree to the waiver(s) if they haven't already done so for the current season.
6. The profile has now joined the competition and will show up in the "Profiles" tab for the competition on the admin side.
7. Administrators may now assign profiles to the teams, and leverage the team recommendations feature.

We've provided two videos outlining these steps.

One from the perspective of a registrant: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTktPArWNqM&t=132s>

Another from the perspective of an administrator: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6SeM3J4pgQ&t=345s>

We are always looking for ways to streamline this process, so please provide feedback on our feedback board if you have any ideas. <https://curling.canny.io/clubs>

# Draw Schedule

## Walkthrough Video[​](#walkthrough-video "Direct link to Walkthrough Video")

The following video will take you, the curling club or event manager, through the basics of setting up teams for a league or competition. If you're new to Curling IO, it's worthwhile to watch this before wading through the rest of our documentation.

## Finding the Draw Schedule Section[​](#finding-the-draw-schedule-section "Direct link to Finding the Draw Schedule Section")

You can generate and / or manually create a draw schedule for each of your leagues and competitions. To get to the draw schedule screen, first click on the name of a league or competition.

![Events List](/assets/images/events-d18b109ded429fddd604c714df19b8be.png)

You should then see a list of tabs near the top. Click on the **Schedule** tab.

![Draw Schedule Navigation](/assets/images/navigation-b9706b8d415dd8bc7339993a76265b7b.png)

## Settings[​](#settings "Direct link to Settings")

Before you can generate a draw schedule, Curling IO first needs some basic information. Click the *Change Settings* button to provide this information.

### Number of sheets[​](#number-of-sheets "Direct link to Number of sheets")

This will default to the number of sheets defined in your [club settings](/docs/club-management/settings.md), but you can override it here if you are using fewer sheets for a specific league or competition.

### Sheet prefix[​](#sheet-prefix "Direct link to Sheet prefix")

Do you want to call them "Sheets" or "Ice" in the public view of your draw schedule.

### Sheet ordering[​](#sheet-ordering "Direct link to Sheet ordering")

Do you want to order your sheets by alphanumeric (A, B, C, ... A1, B1, etc.) or numeric (1, 2, 3, ... 27, 28, etc.)?

### Show sheets[​](#show-sheets "Direct link to Show sheets")

Do you want to display the sheet names on the public view of your draw schedule?

### Interval[​](#interval "Direct link to Interval")

How often do the draws occur? For leagues this is usually *Every Week*, but could also be *Every Other Week* or *Every Day*.

### Draw days[​](#draw-days "Direct link to Draw days")

A comma separated list of the day of the week that your draws occur on. If it's one draw per week, every Monday, just enter "Monday". If it's two draws per week, every Tuesday and Thursday, enter "Tuesday, Thursday".

### Draw times[​](#draw-times "Direct link to Draw times")

A comma separated list of draw times. If your league is every Monday at 7:00 PM, just enter "7:00 pm". If your league is every Monday at 7:00 PM and 9:45 PM, enter "7:00 pm, 9:45 pm".

### Exclude dates[​](#exclude-dates "Direct link to Exclude dates")

If there are any days that fall within your schedule that should not have a draw, you can specify it here. For example, to exclude christmas, you would enter "Dec 25".

## Schedule Generation[​](#schedule-generation "Direct link to Schedule Generation")

Curling IO will do it's best to automatically generate your draw schedule when you ask it to do so.

The auto-generation will use matching [draw schedule templates](/docs/event-management/draw-schedule-templates.md) provided by Curling IO or custom templates specific to your club. If there's more than one matching draw schedule template, you will be prompted to choose which one to use.

If there are no matching draw schedule templates, then we will attempt to auto-assemble your draw schedule. This is usually a good starting place, but you may need to make some manual tweaks.

## Manual Scheduling[​](#manual-scheduling "Direct link to Manual Scheduling")

You can click on any game cell (combination of draw and sheet) and a dropdown will appear listing the available games that can be scheduled. If the dropdown doesn't appear, make sure you remove the contents of the cell first.

![Manual Edit](/assets/images/manual-edit-96236852660f51d001987ef8f5d15a8a.png)

Only the games that can be assigned will be shown. If a a game is already scheduled it won't show up in the dropdown, and if you need to reschedule it, you first need to remove it from the game cell where it is already scheduled. If a team is already playing during a draw you won't be able to schedule that team again for the same draw (a team can't play two games at the same time).

You can add draws to your schedule by clicking the "Add Draw" near the bottom right of the screen. You can remove draws from your schedule by clicking the "X" button next to the draw. You can undo all of the changes made since your last save by clicking the "Reset" button.

When you're happy with your draw schedule, click the "Save" button to save it.

## Removing All Draws[​](#removing-all-draws "Direct link to Removing All Draws")

If you want to start over, we've provided a button to remove all of your existing draws from the league or competition. Since schedule generation will always try to append to the existing schedule, there may be an occasion where you will want to clear it out completely and generate it again from scratch or maybe assemble your entire schedule manually.

## Open Source[​](#open-source "Direct link to Open Source")

Our draw scheduling application is open source! More details can be found on the project's github page here: <https://pairshaped.github.io/curlingio-draws/>

# Draw Schedule Templates

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

Draw schedules templates allow you, the curling club manager, to pre-create draw schedules that you will re-use between multiple leagues and competitions year after year.

Curling IO provides a standard set of templates, which will likely grow over time.

You can copy these templates as a starting point or create your own from scratch.

When you generate a draw schedule for one of your leagues or competitions, Curling IO will find any templates that closely match the number of teams and sheets, then ask you to select which one you would like to use.

tip

Draw Schedule Templates use the same schedule builder as [CurlingSchedules.com](/docs/advanced/curlingschedules.md). You can create schedules there and import them into Curling IO, or create them directly within Curling IO. The main difference is that templates in Curling IO are saved to your club's database instead of your browser's local storage.

## Finding Draw Schedule Templates[​](#finding-draw-schedule-templates "Direct link to Finding Draw Schedule Templates")

Within your admin area, click on the **Club** dropdown menu in the top bar and then click on **Draw Schedule Templates**.

![Navigation](/assets/images/navigation-c78594d7cda184de4fd706ef4358f0cb.png)

## The Basics[​](#the-basics "Direct link to The Basics")

### Creating the Template[​](#creating-the-template "Direct link to Creating the Template")

When you first create the template, you need to fill in a few required fields and then we'll generate all of the games for you.

#### Name[​](#name "Direct link to Name")

Give your draw schedule template a description name. As an example, the name of one of our standard templates is "Standard: 8 teams, 4 sheets".

If the template is custom to a specific league or competition though, you will probably name it after that league or competition.

#### Teams[​](#teams "Direct link to Teams")

How many teams will there be for this draw schedule? If you are running 2 pools, please double the number of teams. For example, 2 pools of 8 teams each will require your draw schedule template to specify 16 teams.

#### Sheets[​](#sheets "Direct link to Sheets")

How many sheets are being used for this draw schedule?

#### Draws[​](#draws "Direct link to Draws")

How many draws will there be in this draw schedule?

#### Pools[​](#pools "Direct link to Pools")

If you are running multiple round robin stages (pools). Multiple pools are assumed to have the same number of teams in each. For example, 2 pools of 8 teams each, will assign team numbers of 1-8 for the first pool, and 9-16 for the second pool.

When using a multiple pool draw schedule template, each of your pools must have the same number of teams and sheets.

### Using the Schedule Builder[​](#using-the-schedule-builder "Direct link to Using the Schedule Builder")

After creating the template, you'll use a visual schedule builder to create your draw schedule. This is the same schedule builder used on curlingschedules.com.

#### Top Controls[​](#top-controls "Direct link to Top Controls")

The controls above the schedule grid let you adjust the size of your draw and regenerate the layout.

**Teams dropdown**

Choose how many teams participate (2–48). When you change the team count, the schedule builder will create a new baseline layout that you can then customize.

**Sheets dropdown**

Pick the number of sheets you'll use (1–16). When you lower the count, excluded sheets disappear from the grid; when you raise it, new empty columns are added.

**Optimize / Reset button**

Run the optimizer to improve fairness without disturbing games you've manually placed. If the schedule is already optimal for your settings, this button will be disabled.

**Shuffle button**

Randomize the teams across your schedule while maintaining fairness. Use it to explore different matchup patterns.

#### Fairness Metrics Bar[​](#fairness-metrics-bar "Direct link to Fairness Metrics Bar")

A line beginning with "Repeats per team" shows how balanced your schedule is. "Repeats per team" shows the maximum number of times any team appears, "consecutive" counts unwanted back-to-back games, and "total" counts extra games beyond a perfect round robin. Lower numbers mean a more balanced schedule.

#### Schedule Grid[​](#schedule-grid "Direct link to Schedule Grid")

The central table shows your full draw with one row per draw and one column per sheet.

**Column headers**

Each header shows the sheet label and a toggle icon. Click the icon to exclude or re-enable a sheet. Excluded sheets turn gray and are ignored by the optimizer until re-enabled.

**Table cells**

Cells show each game as a draggable box. Drag a game to another cell to move it, or drag it onto another game to swap the two. Cells highlight in yellow when they're valid targets, and red when a move would create a conflict (like the same team playing twice in one draw).

**Bye column**

When you have an odd number of teams, a final column shows "BYE" slots to ensure each team gets one rest. These slots help you verify that byes rotate evenly through all teams.

**Drag-and-drop tips**

* Drag a game to another cell to move it; drop on an occupied cell to swap the two games
* Yellow outlines mark valid targets; red outlines mean the move would create a conflict
* Drop a game onto the queue at the bottom to remove it from the schedule while keeping it available to place later
* The optimizer respects games you've manually placed

#### Sidebar[​](#sidebar "Direct link to Sidebar")

The sidebar provides quick actions for managing your template and adjusting settings.

**Schedules**

In Curling IO, your templates are saved to your club's database rather than your browser's local storage. This means:

* **Save**: Saves your current template to the database. You can check the "Active" checkbox to make it available when generating draw schedules
* **Load**: If editing an existing template, you can reload it to discard any unsaved changes
* **Import code**: You can paste a share code from CurlingSchedules.com to import a schedule you created there

**Settings**

Name your template and adjust the sheet labels (numeric or alphabetic). Click Apply to save your changes.

**Game queue**

Drag games here to temporarily remove them from the schedule. Games in the queue can be dragged back into any cell on the grid.

## Copying a Draw Schedule Template[​](#copying-a-draw-schedule-template "Direct link to Copying a Draw Schedule Template")

You can copy any of your existing draw schedule templates to use them as a starting point for further customization. When viewing the template list, click the **Copy** link next to the template you want to duplicate.

The copied template will be created with "(Copy)" added to its name and will be set to inactive status until you review and activate it.

## Deleting Draw Schedule Templates[​](#deleting-draw-schedule-templates "Direct link to Deleting Draw Schedule Templates")

To remove a draw schedule template, click the **Delete** link next to it in the template list. You can only delete templates created for your club - global templates provided by Curling IO cannot be deleted.

# Event Managers

## Walkthrough Video[​](#walkthrough-video "Direct link to Walkthrough Video")

The following video will take you, the curling club manager, through the basics of granting access just to the event features for a league or competition.

## Finding the Event Managers Section[​](#finding-the-event-managers-section "Direct link to Finding the Event Managers Section")

You can grant a user restricted access to manage specific leagues or competitions without letting them to the rest of your club's administration area. For example if you had a commercial league that was managed by someone who isn't a club staff member, or you wanted to grant only game scoring access to a tablet at the club. To get to the event managers screen, first click on the name of a league or competition.

![Events List](/assets/images/events-d18b109ded429fddd604c714df19b8be.png)

You should then see a list of tabs near the top. Click on the **Event managers** tab.

![Event Managers Navigation](/assets/images/navigation-299bdfa254795f533bde5e73f96aec9b.png)

## Adding an Event Manager[​](#adding-an-event-manager "Direct link to Adding an Event Manager")

To add a manager to a specific league or competition, first click on the **New event manager** button.

On the next screen, enter the name of the manager and their email address to invite them to manage the league or competition.

You can also restrict what they'll have access to by checking / unchecking the different sections listed.

![Add Event Manager](/assets/images/add-event-manager-4e3d942c85ba578fb1f743cab5249f87.png)

When done, click the **Create Event manager** button and an email will be sent to the email address provided letting them know that they now have access to manage the league or competition. A link to manage the league or competition is included in the email.

## Removing an Event Manager[​](#removing-an-event-manager "Direct link to Removing an Event Manager")

You can remove an event manager by click the **Remove** link next to the manager.

# Playoff Brackets

## Walkthrough Video[​](#walkthrough-video "Direct link to Walkthrough Video")

The following video will take you, the curling club or event manager, through the basics of creating playoff brackets for a league or competition.

## Finding the Playoff Brackets[​](#finding-the-playoff-brackets "Direct link to Finding the Playoff Brackets")

To get to the stages screen and manage your playoff brackets, first click on the name of a league of competition.

![Events List](/assets/images/events-d18b109ded429fddd604c714df19b8be.png)

You should then see a list of tabs near the top. Click on the **Stages** tab.

![Stages Navigation](/assets/images/navigation-b267264a260493a3bc180c2e5229b896.png)

## Playoff Brackets[​](#playoff-brackets "Direct link to Playoff Brackets")

Our bracket builder makes it easy for you to setup elimination brackets / tournaments. Your events can mix round robins and brackets. E.g. Round robin league play ending in an elimination playoff bracket.

Click the **New bracket** button to create a playoff bracket.

*Playoff Bracket Cheat Sheet* ![Playoff Bracket Cheat Sheet](/assets/images/playoff-bracket-a6483cf623c2cbc05db218f042006b67.png)

### Groups[​](#groups "Direct link to Groups")

* You can have one or more groups in a bracket. Usually these would be named "Group 1", "Group 2", or "A Event", "B Event", etc.
* Edit a group's name by clicking the pencil icon next to it.
* Click the group's name to collapse or show it's grid of games.
* Add new groups by clicking the "Add Group" button at the bottom of the screen.
* Remove a group on it's edit screen if it's empty (has no games).
* You can connect game results between brackets. For example, you could have a B event where teams that have lost play each other, and the winner of the B event could play the winner of the A event in a consolation game.

### Games[​](#games "Direct link to Games")

* Add new games by double clicking on a blank area within a group.
* Click the red ✘ in the top right corner of a game to remove that game.
* Move games around by clicking the header of the game (where the game name is), holding down, and dragging the game to a new location. You can even drag games between groups.
* Double click on a game to edit it and / or assign teams.
* Click and drag a game's green "W" (winner) or red "L" (loser) circle icon to a game position (top of bottom slot) of another game to connect the potential winner or loser to their next game. For example you can click the green "W" of a semifinal game and drag it to the top slot of the final game.
* The grid will automatically grow or shrink as you move games near it's edges.

### Saving[​](#saving "Direct link to Saving")

None of your changes are persisted until you click the "Save" button. So feel free to play around since you can cancel your changes at any time.

## Open Source[​](#open-source "Direct link to Open Source")

Our bracket builder is open source! More details can be found on the project's github page here: <https://pairshaped.github.io/curlingio-bracket-builder/>

## How Winners and Losers Flow Through Brackets[​](#how-winners-and-losers-flow-through-brackets "Direct link to How Winners and Losers Flow Through Brackets")

When you connect games using the winner (green "W") and loser (red "L") connections, you're setting up automatic advancement paths for your bracket.

**Setting up connections:**

* Drag the green "W" from one game to a slot in another game - the winner will automatically go there
* Drag the red "L" from one game to a slot in another game - the loser will automatically go there
* You can connect winners and losers to different games (common in double-elimination or consolation brackets)
* Connections can chain through multiple levels (quarterfinals → semifinals → finals)

**When scores are entered:** Once you've set up these connections and start entering scores on the Scores tab:

* Winners and losers automatically populate their next games as soon as you save each result
* You don't need to manually assign teams to downstream games
* The bracket updates in real-time as games are completed
* Multi-level cascading works automatically - if a semifinal winner advances to the final, that happens immediately

**How team changes work:**

* Each game has two sides (top and bottom) that serve as the connection point between teams and their game results
* When a team advances into a game, they're assigned to a side and inherit whatever is associated with that side
* For first-round games (or any game without an incoming connection), you can manually assign or change teams at any time
* For games that are fed by winner/loser connections, you cannot directly change the team - instead, change the team in the source game and the change will propagate forward automatically
* If you change a score resulting in a different winner, the new winner/loser will propagate to downstream games, taking over the sides there
* The only time teams cannot be automatically swapped is when shot-by-shot data has been recorded (used in about 1% of events), since that data is tied to specific curlers

**Common bracket patterns:**

* **Single elimination:** Only use winner connections - losers are eliminated
* **Double elimination:** Use loser connections to create a "B bracket" where losing teams get a second chance
* **Consolation games:** Connect the losers from semifinals to a 3rd place game
* **A/B/C Events:** Create multiple groups and connect losers from the A Event to the B Event, etc.

The key is to set up your connections before the event starts, then just enter scores and let the system handle team advancement.

# Registrations

You can manage the registrations for each of your leagues or competitions. To get to the registrations screen, first click on the name of a league or competition.

![Events List](/assets/images/events-d18b109ded429fddd604c714df19b8be.png)

You will then see a list of tabs near the top. Click on the **Registrations** tab.

![Registrations Navigation](/assets/images/navigation-034d76db2703690fbac922355d496414.png)

From this screen you can download a CSV file of your events registrations, and you can edit the registrations themselves.

A scenario where you might want to edit a registration, is if you are asking for a **Team name**, **Skip name**, or **Lineup**, and need to correct an entry due to a typo or convention. For example, say there are four registrations for the same team, the first entered *"Jones"*, the second entered *"Team Joness"*, and the last two entered *"Team Jones"*. You can edit the first two registrations to have them all have *"Team Jones"* for the team name. This will come in handy later when you are assembling the teams.

# Round Robins

To get to the stages screen and manage your round robins, first click on the name of a league of competition.

![Events List](/assets/images/events-d18b109ded429fddd604c714df19b8be.png)

You should then see a list of tabs near the top. Click on the **Stages** tab.

![Stages Navigation](/assets/images/navigation-b267264a260493a3bc180c2e5229b896.png)

## Round Robins[​](#round-robins "Direct link to Round Robins")

Before you can schedule or score your games, you need to create those games by creating a Round Robin stage.

Click the **New round robin** button to create a round robin.

### Name[​](#name "Direct link to Name")

If you have more than one stage what you name your round robin will show up on the public site in a dropdown menu.

If you just have the one stage, a common name you might use is "Regular Season".

### Iterations[​](#iterations "Direct link to Iterations")

How many times should teams play each other?

An iteration of *1* will generate games where every team plays every other team one time. For example, a round robin with *8 teams* and *2 iterations* will generate *56 games* where each team plays every other team *twice*.

### Ranking Method[​](#ranking-method "Direct link to Ranking Method")

This is how teams will be ranked for your event's standings. Provincial and National competitions will typically assign 1 point per win, 0 for ties (since there are no ties), and 0 for losses. Most club leagues will use 3 points per win, 1 point per tie, and 0 point per loss.

### Tiebreaker[​](#tiebreaker "Direct link to Tiebreaker")

How do you want to handle point assignment for ties? Provincial and national competitions will typically break tied teams into recursive subgroups for head to head comparisons and fall back to the skill ranking if teams are still tied after breaking out into their smallest possible head to head groups. For most club leagues it's usually OK to have teams tied in the standings and you can select *None*.

### Results carry over to[​](#results-carry-over-to "Direct link to Results carry over to")

You can have this round robin's results carry over to another round robin for combined standings (a.k.a. crossover). For example; the top four teams from two qualifier round robins, Pool A and Pool B, carrying into a championship round. You will still need to assign the teams that carry over.

### Team Assignment[​](#team-assignment "Direct link to Team Assignment")

These are the teams that will participate in the round robin. If you haven't assembled the teams yet, you can still generate the games and draw schedule. The system will simply mark any unassigned team slot as *TBD*.

![Team Assignment](/assets/images/team-assignment-22c5d354c647e832e641b1940f38ed6c.png)

### Notes[​](#notes "Direct link to Notes")

After saving a round robin, the system will generate all of it's games in the background. It might take a few seconds before this completes and you can set up the draw schedule.

When you make changes to a round robin that affect the games generated you may have to edit or rebuild your draw schedule to compensate those changes.

## Scoring a Game[​](#scoring-a-game "Direct link to Scoring a Game")

With the game window open, you can click the button for who won or lost, which will automatically select the opposite option for the opponent. You can optionally enter a score if you want to keep track.

![Scoring a Game](/assets/images/scoring-a-game-9410b3d2e6c640e834a9a94eccb80731.png)

Click the **Save** button when you're done to save the changes.

## End Scores[​](#end-scores "Direct link to End Scores")

**[This is a Premium Only Feature](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

If end scores are enabled for your league or competition, you'll be presented with more options:

![End Scores](/assets/images/end-scores-a7772647577e23f279cb2cf069700996.png)

* Scoring each end.
* Setting which team has the first hammer (last shot in first end).
* Choosing the rock color for each team.
* If a game is tied after all ends have been played (10), we will keep adding new ends until one team scores, or until you set the result to "Tied".

## Open Source[​](#open-source "Direct link to Open Source")

Our scoring application is open source! More details can be found on the project's github page here: <https://pairshaped.github.io/curlingio-scoring/>

## How Bracket Advancement Works[​](#how-bracket-advancement-works "Direct link to How Bracket Advancement Works")

When you enter a score for a bracket game, the system automatically advances teams to their next games based on the winner/loser connections you've set up in the bracket builder.

**What happens automatically:**

* The winning team moves to the next game if you've connected the winner (green "W") to another game
* The losing team moves to their next game if you've connected the loser (red "L") to another game
* This happens immediately when you save the score
* Multi-level brackets work automatically - teams flow through quarterfinals → semifinals → finals without any extra work

**Understanding game sides:**

* Each game has two sides (top and bottom positions) that associate teams with their results
* When a team advances into a game, they're assigned to one of these sides
* The side holds the score, outcome, and other game data - not the team itself
* This means teams can be swapped in and out, and they'll take over whatever results are associated with that side
* The only exception is shot-by-shot data (used in about 1% of events), which tracks specific curlers and cannot be reassigned to different teams

**Removing or changing scores:**

* If you change a score that results in a different winner, the new winner/loser will propagate to downstream games
* The new teams will take over the sides in downstream games, inheriting any scores or data already there

**Changing teams in bracket games:**

* For first-round games (or any game without an incoming winner/loser connection), you can manually change the teams at any time
* For games that are fed by another game's winner or loser, you cannot directly change the team - instead, change the team in the source game and that change will propagate forward through all connected games

This automatic advancement means you can focus on entering scores and let the system handle moving teams through your bracket.

# Teams

## Walkthrough Video[​](#walkthrough-video "Direct link to Walkthrough Video")

The following video will take you, the curling club or event manager, through the basics of setting up teams for a league. If you're new to Curling IO, it's worthwhile to watch this before wading through the rest of our documentation.

## Finding the Teams Section[​](#finding-the-teams-section "Direct link to Finding the Teams Section")

You can assemble teams for each of your leagues or competitions. To get to the teams screen, first click on the name of a league of competition.

![Events List](/assets/images/events-d18b109ded429fddd604c714df19b8be.png)

You should then see a list of tabs near the top. Click on the **Teams** tab.

![Teams Navigation](/assets/images/navigation-48bc20a29000445e6f0cf9871e4b2d31.png)

## Team Recommendations[​](#team-recommendations "Direct link to Team Recommendations")

If you asked for a team or skip name for your event, then you can leverage Curling IO's team recommendations. Click on the **Recommendations** button. If you don't see this button it is because you aren't asking for a team or skip name and therefor the system cannot assemble teams for you.

On the recommendations screen, you will see a list of team suggestions. These suggestions will be updated whenever a new registration occurs, and will include *New Team* suggestions as well as *Team Update* suggestions as new teams and curlers register.

Click the **Create Team** or **Update Team** button to accept the recommendation and assemble your teams.

If you find that there are multiple copies for the same team that have slightly different names (*"Jones"* vs. *"Team Jones"*), you can go to the [registrations tab](/docs/event-management/registrations.md) and fix the team or skip names so that they are identical and then come back here.

![Team Miss-match](/assets/images/team-missmatch-f8c42d661353bc63621d7d20c75a2aba.png)

![Team Match](/assets/images/team-match-db55bdf95d01b58cddfe5e8cc289516a.png)

We will also copy over the team contact name, phone, email, coach, and affiliation from the registration if are being asked and filled in.

## Import Teams[​](#import-teams "Direct link to Import Teams")

You can import teams from another event from the current season that matches the team restriction (Men's, Women's, Mixed, etc.). This is useful to copy teams from a preliminary competition or a semester / trimester leagues (Fall, Winter, Spring). When you import teams, it will also add any curlers assigned to these teams to your event, so be careful to select the correct event as there is no Undo button and you'll end up cleaning up both your teams and curlers if you select the wrong event.

## Manual Team Assembly[​](#manual-team-assembly "Direct link to Manual Team Assembly")

You can manually assemble teams regardless of whether or not you're using our team recommendations. Maybe our team recommendations covered most of your teams, but you need to tweak a few assignments.

![Team Match](/assets/images/manual-assignment-7a956cf9e88c0b9d565a9d44c440166d.png)

You can add or modify the team's:

* Name
* Short Name (for the draw schedule)
* Contact Information
* Coach
* Lineup

You can also pre-create your teams before or while registrations are coming in if you want to setup your round robins and draw schedules ahead of time. You don't need to assign curlers to teams to have round robins, draw schedules, and scores.

# Curler Profiles

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

Curler profiles in Curling IO are persistent and can be used again for future registrations in the same or future seasons or even at other clubs or membership associations without needing to re-enter all of your information.

You can also create profiles for your children or someone you are a legal guardian for, all on the same account.

When creating a profile if you have more than one email address, you can enter them in the primary and secondary email address fields. Doing so, will ensure that if you accidentally login with one of these alternative email addresses, you will still be able to see and use your profile for registrations.

![Example Curler Profiles](/assets/images/curler-profiles-187abd032cdf512fd78611a2be13882c.png)

## Creating a Curler Profile[​](#creating-a-curler-profile "Direct link to Creating a Curler Profile")

If you've never registered with Curling IO before then you'll most likely be asked to create a new profile. Once you've created a profile it will be available for all future registrations (no need to keep keying in the same information).

Just follow the instructions and fill in the required information to continue.

After creating your profile you may be asked to accept one or more waivers specific to your club before you can continue.

## Updating a Curler Profile[​](#updating-a-curler-profile "Direct link to Updating a Curler Profile")

If you previously registered for a league, competition, or product you probably have a profile in our system. You can make changes to your profile at any time following these steps.

Make sure you login with the same email address you used to create the profile, or an email address that is associated with the profile (primary or secondary email for the curler). If you aren't, then you won't be able to see or make changes to your curler profile.

1. Login first, if you aren't already signed in.
2. Click on the "Account" dropdown near the top right of the screen.
3. Click on the "Profiles" link in the Account dropdown.
4. Click on "View Profile" for the profile you want to edit.
5. Click on the "Edit" button at the bottom of the screen.

## Privacy Concerns[​](#privacy-concerns "Direct link to Privacy Concerns")

Rest assured that the Curling IO business model isn't to inundate you with advertisements, monopolize your attention, or sell your data like some other popular online platforms.

If you're concerned about who will see your Profile data however, please review our [privacy statement](/privacy.md) and [terms of use](/terms.md) for more details.

# Google Login Without Gmail

You can use a non-gmail email account to login using the "Login with Gmail" button. Just click the link below and follow the steps to associate your non-gmail with a Google account.

[Setup Google login without Gmail](https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail)

More detailed instructions can be found here: [How to Make a Google Account Without Gmail](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Google-Account-Without-Gmail)


---

# How do I Login?

It's simple, but first you need an email address.

If you don't have an email address, you can easily get a free one from Gmail, FastMail, Microsoft, ProtonMail, and about a hundred or so others. You can also ask your internet service provider if they can set you up with one.

## Step by Step[​](#step-by-step "Direct link to Step by Step")

1. Click the Login link in the top right of this screen. If you don't see a "Login" link, then you're probably already logged in, and can skip the rest of these instructions.
2. You should now see a screen giving you two options: Send me a Login Link and Login with Gmail.
3. If you use Gmail then the fastest way to login is simply selecting the red Login with Gmail button and you'll be logged in, and can skip the rest of these instructions.
4. If you don't have a Gmail then you'll need to enter your email address and select the Send me a Login Link button.
5. We will immediately send you an email containing a link that you can click which automatically logs you in.
6. If for some reason you can't click the link, (maybe you sent it to your phone but are using a computer), you can instead copy the "Token" from the email and paste it into the "Token" field back in Curling /O.

That's all there is to it. You should now be logged in, and most likely back on your "Cart" screen.

## Demonstration of Token Method[​](#demonstration-of-token-method "Direct link to Demonstration of Token Method")

![Using the Token](/assets/images/login-token-demo-9dbe6a00603afd00c958ccb0360ac1ea.gif)

The above video loops over and over again. It begins when an email address is entered.

## Complete Walkthrough Video[​](#complete-walkthrough-video "Direct link to Complete Walkthrough Video")

The following short video will take you through the basics of logging in. If you're new to Curling IO and struggling, it might be worth watching.

## Passwordless Authentication[​](#passwordless-authentication "Direct link to Passwordless Authentication")

Curling IO doesn't use passwords, because passwords are the primary cause of most data breaches on the internet.

You'll never have to remember a password with our system. This means your personal information is more secure with us than other registration systems.

[Read more about passwordless logins and their increased security here.](https://auth0.com/blog/is-passwordless-authentication-more-secure-than-passwords/)

# Registering for a League

## Step by Step[​](#step-by-step "Direct link to Step by Step")

1. Find the league you want to join in the leagues section.
2. Click on the "Add to cart" or "Register" button next to the league. If you don't see a button, then the league is either sold out, and hasn't opened up registrations yet.
3. Next you'll be asked to login or sign up. All you need for this step is an email address. Click the "Login / Sign Up" button to continue. If you run into issues logging in, please see our How do I Login? article.
4. Once logged in, you will be taken back to your "Cart". You should see an "Information required" link next to the league. You'll need to assign a profile to the league by clicking the "Information required" link.
5. If you haven't created a profile yet, you'll be prompted to fill out a form with your curler information. Fill out this form to the best of your ability and click the "Save and continue" button. If you already have a profile from a previous registration, you'll be asked to choose a curler profile or create a new one.
6. You may now be asked to review and accept a waiver. You will be instructed to type either "I agree" or "We agree" (for juniors) in order to continue. You only need to agree to this waiver once per season per profile.
7. You will now be prompted to fill out any other information specific to the league you selected. Possibly your lineup or the name of your team. Click the "Save and continue" button once you've filled out the required information.
8. You may see a page with recommendations for other leagues, programs, or products that might interest you. You can add any of these to your cart with a single click, or continue directly to your cart.
9. You should now be taken back to your cart. If this is the first time registering a profile this season you will probably see some additional fees automatically added to your cart.
10. You can now complete your registration by selecting a payment method: "Credit / Debit" or "Cash / Cheque". If you choose the "Cash / Cheque" option you'll need to make arrangements to pay us the amount owed.

## Walkthrough Video[​](#walkthrough-video "Direct link to Walkthrough Video")

The following video will take you through the basics of registration for a league. If you're new to Curling IO and struggling, it might be worth watching.

# Sparing

If your club has enabled the sparing feature for any of their leagues or competitions you will be able to select which of them you are available to spare for, which position(s) you prefer, and other notes you'd like to include.

1. Login first, if you aren't already signed in.
2. Click on the "Account" dropdown near the top right of the screen.
3. Click on the "Sparing" link in the Account dropdown.
4. Click on "Register as a spare" for the profile you want to spare with.
5. Select the event (league or competition), your preferred positions, and include any relevant notes.
6. Submit the form to complete the registration.

![Set Sparing Preferences](/assets/images/sparing-f7ab444e3fbb4ca866a2a3e151ca0447.png)

Note: By registering as a spare your contact information will be shared with other members on the spares screens for relevant leagues and competitions regardless of your profile setting.


---

# My Teams

Once your profile(s) has been assigned to a team in a league or competition, that team will show up in this section. If you don't see any teams here, that may just mean the club hasn't assigned your profile to any teams yet.

When you click on a team name, you will be taken to a list of games that your team is participating in. If your club has enabled **participant scoring** for the league or competition then you will be able to submit scores and results for games you played within the last week.

![Team Games](/assets/images/my-teams-64299ecd321df96dffb2c9fb5e4344a4.png)

# Waitlists

Once a league, competition, or product runs out of space or inventory, you may be presented with an option to join it's waitlist. When you do so, your waitlists will appear on this screen.

1. Login first, if you aren't already signed in.
2. Click on the "Account" dropdown near the top right of the screen.
3. Click on the "Waitlists" link in the Account dropdown.

![Waitlist Registrations](/assets/images/waitlists-b4e5b563d664cfd8fa205cab172bce22.png)

If room or inventory becomes available and club staff approve your waitlist registration, you'll be sent an email with a special link and instructions to purchase the league, competition or product. You will likely have a limited amount of time to claim your waitlisted item before your club moves on to the next person in line.

**Note:** Your waitlist approval allows you to register for exactly one spot. If you try to add multiple quantities to your cart, extras will be automatically removed.

## Canceling Your Waitlist Registration[​](#canceling-your-waitlist-registration "Direct link to Canceling Your Waitlist Registration")

If you're no longer interested in the league, competition, or product, you can cancel your waitlist registration so the next person in line may join.

# Waivers

Your club may ask you to respond to one or more waivers before you can participate at their venue. You'll usually be asked during event registration.

Waivers can be either **required** (you must accept to continue) or **optional** (you can choose to accept or reject). Optional waivers, like photo consent, won't block your registration.

For team registrations, every individual on the team may need to create a curler profile and respond to waivers on their own before they can participate. You cannot accept a waiver for someone unless you are their legal guardian (parent).

## Accepting Waivers[​](#accepting-waivers "Direct link to Accepting Waivers")

1. Login first, if you aren't already signed in.
2. Click on the "Account" dropdown near the top right of the screen.
3. Click on the "Waivers" link in the Account dropdown.
4. Create a curler profile if you don't already have one.
5. If you are required to respond to any waivers, you will be presented with a "Waiver Required" button for each profile that requires it.

## Required vs Optional Waivers[​](#required-vs-optional-waivers "Direct link to Required vs Optional Waivers")

### Required Waivers[​](#required-waivers "Direct link to Required Waivers")

For **required** waivers (like liability releases), you will:

1. See the waiver content
2. Be asked to type acceptance text exactly as shown (e.g., "I agree" for adults or "We agree" for youth)
3. Must complete this to continue registration

### Optional Waivers[​](#optional-waivers "Direct link to Optional Waivers")

For **optional** waivers (like photo consent), you will:

1. See an info banner explaining the waiver is optional
2. See the waiver content
3. Click either **Accept** or **Reject** button to continue
4. Your choice is recorded, but registration continues regardless

**Note:** Rejecting an optional waiver does not affect your ability to participate in club activities.

## Viewing and Changing Waiver Responses[​](#viewing-and-changing-waiver-responses "Direct link to Viewing and Changing Waiver Responses")

You can view your waiver responses from your account waiver section at any time (Account → Curlers).

**Accepted Waivers:**

* Shown as regular clickable links
* Click to view and print the waiver

**Rejected Waivers:**

* Shown in **red text**
* Click to review the waiver again
* You can change your mind and accept a previously rejected waiver at any time

**To Change a Rejected Waiver to Accepted:**

1. Navigate to your profile page (Account → Curlers)
2. Click on the rejected waiver link (shown in red)
3. Review the waiver content
4. Click the "Accept" button

Once you accept a waiver, you cannot change it back to rejected. If you have concerns about a waiver, contact your club administrator.

# Best Practices

This document is for curling club managers that are new to Curling IO or club's who's pricing, fees, or discounts have undergone significant changes for the next season.

If you are brand new to Curling IO then your best bet is to start with our [tutorial videos here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLewhXbqjD6VFr-WlpNC1CGEvF9UV33jLb). Making the up front time investment to understand your curler registration system will save you a ton of time and headaches down the road once you've started taking registrations.

We'll start by outlining some general best practices with the reasoning behind them, and then go through specific examples we've seen clubs struggle with.

## Individual League Registrations[​](#individual-league-registrations "Direct link to Individual League Registrations")

We highly recommend that your members register for your leagues as individuals rather than as a team. By default league registrations are individual. The "Requires curler profile" checkbox is what determines this. You can uncheck this box to accept team registrations, but this is almost always a mistake. If you do uncheck this box, then it is important you don't have any seasonal fees or addons that require a curler profile associated with the league. This includes affiliate fees, which we cannot track for you unless you are taking individual registrations. Waivers are also tied to curler profiles, so if you aren't requiring curler profiles you may need a separate process to collect waivers or some way communicate with your curlers that they still need to create a profile and accept the waiver.

Individual registration has multiple benefits:

1. You can accurately capture membership and affiliation fees per member per season. Curling IO will remember which fees a curler has already paid each season and they won't be charged more than once. Alternatively, with team registrations, if these fees are embedded within team prices, you will *double dip* when one of your members is in multiple leagues.
2. Addons like lockers can be associated with individual curlers when they register for their leagues.
3. You can still gather team and position information simply by asking for the team or skip name and their position. Curling IO will later make team recommendations based on these fields if you are using our league management features.
4. Through the use of discounts and custom fields you can still offer individual discounts based on team size. For example, you can ask if it's a 5 person team and offer a 20% off discount for each individual who selects it.

### Team Size Discounts[​](#team-size-discounts "Direct link to Team Size Discounts")

If your pricing has been historically team based, you'll want to offer a percentage discount to members who play on a 5 or 6 player team. The easiest way to do this is to simply ask them using a custom field.

1. Create a new custom field for "Number of players on team".
2. Select "Dropdown" as the type of field.
3. Enter "Four, Five, Six" for the options.
4. Create a 5 player 20% discount, using the custom field criteria. Select the custom field you created in the drop down and enter "Five" as the value.
5. Create a 6 player 33.33% discount, using the custom field criteria. Select the custom field you created in the drop down and enter "Six" as the value.
6. For each of the relevant leagues add the "Number of players on team" to the custom fields and make it required. This will force every member to select Four, Five, or Six when they register.
7. For each of the relevant leagues add both the 5 player and the 6 player discount.

Now when your members register for a league they will be asked how many players are on their team. If they select "Five" then they will receive a 20% discount. If all 5 members of the team do this, they will together pay the total team price for the league.

Here's a tutorial video discussing and covering these discount options.

## Avoid Complex Discount Combinations[​](#avoid-complex-discount-combinations "Direct link to Avoid Complex Discount Combinations")

We know that sometimes this can't be helped, but we recommend staying away from complicated discount schemes. If you can't quickly grasp your discount logic without using a spreadsheet, then your curlers probably can't either. If the discounts aren't obvious to your curlers then they likely aren't serving the intended purpose of increasing registrations / sales.

Some of our clubs are suprised to discover how complex their discounts are once they codify (automate) them for the first time.

Here are a few notes to consider:

1. Why are you offering a specific discount? What is it's purpose and is it achieving it's goal? Try to phase out grandfathered discounts that are no longer beneficial.
2. If a specific league or set of leagues (like winter leagues due to snowbirds) aren't filling up, then the simplest approach is to just reduce their price instead of creating potentially complex multi-item discounts.
3. If you are offering multiple item discounts, but also half season discounts, what discount(s) does a member receive when they register for one full season league and one half season league?
4. If you are offering a student / couple / family / first timer discount, how are you determining who is a student / couple / family / first timer? Inevitably any of these will require custom fields and asking them during registration, and then you'll need to police it.
5. Do your discounts stack with each other? Do only a subset of your discounts stack? Should a member receiving a 2 item discount, a half season discount, a senior discount, and a first timer discount all added together?
6. In general half-season leagues (semester or trimester setups) are better off being their own separate leagues as they have their own teams, stages, standings, schedules. This is easier to reason about than half-season discounts for full season leagues.

If you have questions about your discounts, [please watch our discounts tutorial before contacting support.](https://youtu.be/3h7oZzkYfkM)

## Make Sure Fees are Required[​](#make-sure-fees-are-required "Direct link to Make Sure Fees are Required")

When assigning your seasonal fees to your leagues or products, make sure you mark them as required. Curling IO keeps track of which curlers have paid which seasonal fees and won't charge them again within the same season.

If you do not mark them as required, then you will miss collecting a lot of fees because the member didn't check the box to pay these fees.

## Assign Fees, Addons, and Discounts to Leagues[​](#assign-fees-addons-and-discounts-to-leagues "Direct link to Assign Fees, Addons, and Discounts to Leagues")

Just creating the fee, addon, or discount doesn't actually affect anything until you assign it to the appropriate leagues, products, or competitions.

If your "Monday Night Open" should have a Junior Discount of 50% for members 17 and under, then you need to make sure you associate this discount with it.

If you have questions about setting up your leagues, [please watch our leagues tutorial before contacting support.](https://youtu.be/LSuo6UbLBJ0)

## Assign Custom Fields and Discounts[​](#assign-custom-fields-and-discounts "Direct link to Assign Custom Fields and Discounts")

If you have a discount who's criteria relies on the answer to a custom field, then you need to associate both the custom field and the discount to the item being discounted.

For example if you want to offer a "New Curler" discount for your "Monday Night Open" league:

1. Create a "New Curler?" custom field dropdown to ask if they are a new curler with "Yes, No" options.
2. Create a "New Curler" discount with the criteria that they answer "Yes" to my "New Curler?" custom field.
3. Assign both the "New Curler?" custom field and the "New Curler" discount to the "Monday Night Open" league.

Now when your members register for this league and answer "Yes" that they are a new curler, they will receive the new curler discount.

We also recommend using a dropdown instead of a checkbox for custom fields that are used by a discount's criteria. The reason for this is that you can make a dropdown required to force your members to see it. If you make a checkbox required it means that everyone must check it off (and everyone then gets the discount). If you make a checkbox optional and there are no other required fields for the league or product, then your member's may never even see it because they aren't forced to during registration. With a dropdown you can make it required without automatically giving everyone the discount, but are making sure they will all see it.

If you have questions about setting up your leagues, [please watch our leagues tutorial before contacting support.](https://youtu.be/LSuo6UbLBJ0)

## Don't spam yourself with registration emails[​](#dont-spam-yourself-with-registration-emails "Direct link to Don't spam yourself with registration emails")

Your leagues, competitions, and products have a "Notification email" field. This should only be used to send emails to people who aren't also administrators, like an outside dedicated league manager or someone running a commercial league. If you are an administrator you already have access to all of your recent orders from the [Orders Screen](/docs/club-management/orders.md). If you're sending thousands of emails to your club's email address and someone with access happens to get annoyed and marks any of them as spam, the system will immediately stop sending you any emails, including other potentially important emails.

## Use a separate non-administrator email for registration nights[​](#use-a-separate-non-administrator-email-for-registration-nights "Direct link to Use a separate non-administrator email for registration nights")

Ideally all of your members are registering themselves using their own email address, but for for those who are not able to create / login to their own email address (even with your help), we recommend creating a separate registration specific account (email) to hold these curler profiles and orders. For example, signing up for a free gmail account like "<club-name-registrations@gmail.com>", and using that to login a laptop or tablet as a sort of kiosk at the club for in-person registrations.

This not only keeps these curler profiles organized within one dedicated registration-only account, it's also more secure for a public computer since this account won't need or have admin access.

If you want to be able to handle multiple registrations at the same time on this registration account (multiple kiosks), please let us know and we can flag it as a "multicart" account to avoid having these multiple instances of the login from clobbering each other's cart.

[FAQ entry on: What is an Account?](/docs/getting-started/faq.md#what-is-an-account)

## Test Your Registrations[​](#test-your-registrations "Direct link to Test Your Registrations")

Make sure that you test each possible registration scenario before you open up registration to your members. This can save you a ton of headaches in the long run trying to fix mistakes and refund payments.

Curling IO has a lot of flexibility, especially when it comes to discounts. This is necessary to support all the different registration methods that different clubs have. Complex setups can result in unexpected outcomes though, so the more complicated your setup, the more testing you should do.

You can test your registrations at any time and even submit the orders. You can then delete these test orders when you're done.

[We have a tutorial video covering what your members experience when registering with Curling IO.](https://youtu.be/6bzxDm_t-JA) This is useful for club staff to understand how it works from the curler's perspective.

## Ask us to Review your Setup[​](#ask-us-to-review-your-setup "Direct link to Ask us to Review your Setup")

If this is your first time your club is using Curling IO, and you've just finished setting everything up, you may ask us to review your setup.

We ask that you read over the relevant documentation and [review our tutorial videos first though](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLewhXbqjD6VFr-WlpNC1CGEvF9UV33jLb).

[If this is not the first time your club is using Curling IO, there are premium support products, like a seasonal refresher, available here.](https://premium.curling.io/en/products) This can be helpful for new managers thrown into the deep end (no knowledge transfer).

DO NOT LEAVE THIS UNTIL THE DAY BEFORE REGISTRATION!

Make sure you're set up well in advance of opening registrations and send us a support request to take a look at least 2 weeks before you open registration.

# Book an Onboarding Session

The goal of an onboarding session is to get the leagues, fees, discounts, and products setup to mirror your club's operations, and answer any questions you may have. **The onboarding session is mandatory before you can start using Curling IO.**

**We require that attendees review our tutorial videos and documentation prior to booking an onboarding session.** A lengthy demo / sales process would require us to charge significantly more, which we don't think our clubs want. [We've provided extensive tutorial videos so you can evaluate Curling IO yourself](https://www.youtube.com/@curlingio).

The onboarding process is a screenshare where we walk through the club setup with you in real time and make sure you're ready to start taking registrations by the end of it. Multiple stakeholders can and should attend the same session. You will be granted administrator access to your club's Curling IO instance at the end of the onboarding session.

Please understand that we cannot run multiple onboarding sessions for your club due to key stakeholders not attending. Everyone who will be using our platform should have some familiarity with Curling IO (please have them watch our videos) and be present during your onboarding session.

Select one of the times below to book your onboarding session.

# Curling Club Management

Curling IO is the #1 curling club management and registration platform. Our focus is to make it easy for curling club managers to take registrations online and manage their leagues.

We also have extremely affordable (and simple) pricing for clubs of all sizes, with no monthly or setup fees.

## Online Registration[​](#online-registration "Direct link to Online Registration")

Curling IO was built from the ground up to manage curling club registrations. It's intuitive and seamless for curlers of all ages to use season after season. In fact, our national curler database makes it even easier to register again after the first season as they won't need to rekey all of their information.

We also make it easy for clubs to accept payments online.

## League and Competition Management[​](#league-and-competition-management "Direct link to League and Competition Management")

We've developed some innovative features to help curling clubs manage their leagues and competitions.

* Automated team recommendations and assembly.
* Round robin generation.
* Drag and drop playoff bracket builder.
* Draw schedule generation with manual override.
* Curler opt-in spares engine.
* Game scoring.
* Results publication.
* Extensive permissions system for third parties to manage your leagues and competitions.

Curling IO manages the competitions for membership associations across Canada and for Curling Canada. If you've ever checked the scoreboard for the Brier's or Scotties on [curling.ca](https://www.curling.ca/scoreboard), then you've already seen Curling IO in action.

## Rental Bookings[​](#rental-bookings "Direct link to Rental Bookings")

Renting out ice and lounge space is a key revenue stream for curling clubs.

* Publish a public-facing rental calendar that updates instantly when new bookings come in.
* Configure rentable resources (sheets, rooms) with availability windows, pricing, and closure dates.
* Collect deposits and waivers online during checkout, reducing back-and-forth email coordination.
* Apply the same addons, fees, and discounts you configure for leagues, products, and programs.

## Bookkeeping and Reports[​](#bookkeeping-and-reports "Direct link to Bookkeeping and Reports")

We have an extensive reports section that curling club managers and bookkeepers love.

Our reports help you figure out your taxes on registrations and really dig down into the data to see how your club is performing financially.

## First Class Support and Documentation[​](#first-class-support-and-documentation "Direct link to First Class Support and Documentation")

Curling IO provides email support.

We also have feedback boards, online documentation (right here), and video tutorials to get you up and running.

# Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does it cost?[​](#how-much-does-it-cost "Direct link to How much does it cost?")

Curling IO pricing starts at 2.7% + $0.30 per online transaction if you are only accepting online payments, and this includes all credit card processing fees. We are introducing some premium only features that will be available to all clubs that are using online payments or as a yearly fee for clubs who are not. See our [pricing section](/docs/getting-started/pricing.md) for more details.

### I'm having trouble signing in[​](#im-having-trouble-signing-in "Direct link to I'm having trouble signing in")

Curling IO doesn't use passwords. You can login using a Google (Gmail) account or you can have a login link / code sent to your email address. [See our login instructions for more details.](/docs/for-curlers/how-do-i-login.md)

### Can I import our club's existing curlers?[​](#can-i-import-our-clubs-existing-curlers "Direct link to Can I import our club's existing curlers?")

Yes, curling club managers can import curlers from a previous season that aren't already registered with Curling IO by uploading a CSV file. CSV files can be exported from any spreadsheet or database program, usually by selecting the "File" menu and selected "Export as" or "Download as" and then selected "CSV". [Here's a sample Google Sheet of what you'll need to provide.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-smgG2v8atZySX68hwoP-gaDJGvD0sGl3_GHZ7XTrtk/edit?usp=sharing) The red columns are required.

It's generally not worth the effort though, as curler's are quick to adopt and key in their profiles once you're using Curling IO.

### Can our club use Curling IO without online payments (for free)?[​](#can-our-club-use-curling-io-without-online-payments-for-free "Direct link to Can our club use Curling IO without online payments (for free)?")

Yes. We have a handful of clubs that are using Curling IO just for offline payments and it doesn't cost them a penny. Our assumption is that eventually your club will adopt online payments out of convenience for both curling club managers and your curlers. Starting with Curling IO for offline payments is a great way for curling club managers to become familiar with the system.

We are introducing some premium only features that will be available to all clubs that are using online payments or as a yearly fee for clubs who are not. [These premium only features are not required to use Curling IO.](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)

Please keep in mind that we need to manage our support costs for clubs that are using our platform for free, and that you'll need to self-serve as much as possible. Every support ticket has a cost for us, and our documentation should cover all of your support needs.

### Does Curling IO include a website?[​](#does-curling-io-include-a-website "Direct link to Does Curling IO include a website?")

Yes. Every club gets integrated website hosting at no additional cost. You will find the settings under **Club Admin → Website**. From there you can publish a customizable landing page, add pages and articles, tailor your colour palette, and optionally restrict member-only content.

If you already maintain another site, you can still run the Curling IO site in parallel—many clubs eventually switch after seeing how closely it ties into registrations, leagues, and products, and how quickly updates publish once you save them.

See the [Website Hosting guide](/docs/club-management/website-hosting.md) for a full overview and screenshots of the editor.

### We have complicated pricing and discounts, will Curling IO support us?[​](#we-have-complicated-pricing-and-discounts-will-curling-io-support-us "Direct link to We have complicated pricing and discounts, will Curling IO support us?")

Yes, some of our clubs have extremely complicated discounts and fees, and Curling IO is very flexible. However, if you've never codified your club's pricing before, expect to spend some time figuring it out.

Eventually, our hope is that you'll simplify your pricing over time to make life easier for both your curlers and club staff.

### Can our curlers register family members?[​](#can-our-curlers-register-family-members "Direct link to Can our curlers register family members?")

Yes, each account (login) can have multiple profiles. Keep in mind that if you are leveraging our waivers, then the person registering family members must be a legal guardian for it to be valid. Coaches should NOT be registering their team's curlers as they are not considered a legal guardian that can accept waivers on their behalf.

### One of our members has two or more duplicate curler profiles, how can I fix that?[​](#one-of-our-members-has-two-or-more-duplicate-curler-profiles-how-can-i-fix-that "Direct link to One of our members has two or more duplicate curler profiles, how can I fix that?")

In the curlers section you can flag profiles as duplicates, and we regularly merge these duplicate profiles. You only need to flag one of them.

### One of our members paid less than they should have[​](#one-of-our-members-paid-less-than-they-should-have "Direct link to One of our members paid less than they should have")

This can happen when you have discounts that curler's can opt in to, like a "First Time Curler?" or "5 players on team" discount. You'll find that occasionally one of your members opt in when they shouldn't have. You have several options to fix this:

1. If payment has not be recorded for the order yet, you're best bet is to [send it back to their cart and have them fix their mistake.](/docs/club-management/orders.md#sending-an-order-back-to-the-accounts-cart)
2. If the order has already been paid, you could [simply refund the order and have them redo it.](/docs/club-management/orders.md#refunds) It's generally easiest to refund to [club credits](/docs/club-management/club-credits.md) so that their previous payment is automatically applied during the repurchase.
3. If the order has already been paid, you could create a product for the difference they owe, [flag it as private](/docs/club-management/products.md#private), and give them the private URL. We generally don't recommend this method as it creates a burden on your bookkeeping.

### One of our members paid seasonal fees more than once[​](#one-of-our-members-paid-seasonal-fees-more-than-once "Direct link to One of our members paid seasonal fees more than once")

If one of your members has paid seasonal fees more than once these are the likely causes:

1. They created a second (duplicate) curler profile. This can happen if they login with a different email address at a later date and that email they used is not also assigned to their original curler profile. Curling IO can't tell that they've already paid their seasonal fees if they aren't using the same curler profile.
2. If it's one of your club fees (and not one of the affiliate fees), double check that you've configured it to be [seasonal per curler (can only be purchased once per season).](/docs/club-management/fees.md#seasonal-per-curler)

### What is an Account?[​](#what-is-an-account "Direct link to What is an Account?")

An account is just an email address and possibly a name to go along with it. When someone first logs in (signs up) to Curling IO, an account is created for them with the email address they logged in with. Essentially you can think of an account as a **login**.

Every account may own one or more curler profiles. Accounts will also be able to see and register with any curler profile that has a primary or secondary email matching the account's email.

This means that when a curler profile is added to the Curling IO, it could be shared between mutliple logins. Some people have and may login with multiple email addresses.

#### Example 1[​](#example-1 "Direct link to Example 1")

1. Hurly has two email addresses; <hurly-buttons@gmail.com> and <hurly-rocks@hotmail.com>.
2. Hurly logs into Curling IO with <hurly-buttons@gmail.com>.
3. Hurly creates a curler profile and enters <hurly-rocks@hotmail.com> as his secondary email address.
4. Months later Hurly logs back into Curling IO using his <hurly-rocks@hotmail.com> email.
5. Curling IO creates a new account for <hurly-rocks@hotmail.com>.
6. Hurly goes to register for another league, and still sees and uses the curler profile he created earlier with his other account.

#### Example 2[​](#example-2 "Direct link to Example 2")

1. Jane logs into Curling IO with <jane-hack@gmail.com>.
2. Jane creates a curler profile for herself and another curler profile for her 17 year old son Jimmy.
3. Her son Jimmy, while a youth curler, has his own email address <jimme-hack@gmail.com>, and Jane enters that email address into his curler profile.
4. Jane registers herself and her son in a league.
5. Her son Jimmy logs into Curler IO a month later to register for another league.
6. During registration Jimmy sees and is able to use the curler profile that his mother created for him earlier.

### One of our members registered for the wrong league[​](#one-of-our-members-registered-for-the-wrong-league "Direct link to One of our members registered for the wrong league")

Occasionally one of your members will register for the wrong league / product / competition.

A common support request is "How do I move them to the correct league". You can't just swap them over because the league you want to move them to may:

* have a different price.
* participate in different discounts.
* have different associated fees.

While none of the above will be true for all cases, the system doesn't have a way to know this.

Depending on the status of the order there are two ways to handle this.

If the order has NOT been paid yet, you can simply either delete the order and have them resubmit or you can [send the order back to their cart](/docs/club-management/orders.md#sending-an-order-back-to-the-accounts-cart). Keep in mind that sending the order back to their cart is not an option if you were registering them using the club multicart login feature.

However if the league has already been paid for the easiest way to handle this is:

1. Refund the incorrect league to Club Credits. Make sure you only check the box for the league when doing the refund. Also make sure you select Club Credits for the refund.
2. Use the "Login as" feature to login to the curler's account. (ignore this if the order was made with an administrator account, but that should never happen right?)
3. Add the new league to your cart and complete the registration. The club credits that were granted from refunding the old league will cover the cost of the new league.

The following video will take you, the curling club manager, through the process of moving a curler from one league to another.

### Can we sell raffle (50 / 50) tickets on Curling IO?[​](#can-we-sell-raffle-50--50-tickets-on-curling-io "Direct link to Can we sell raffle (50 / 50) tickets on Curling IO?")

It depends on which of our payment processors (credit card processors) you are using. If you are using SportsPay, then in general yes, raffles should not be an issue. If you are using Stripe, then no, absolutely not, since this is categorized as a resitrcted business.

You cannot use Curling IO to process online payments for raffle tickets if you are using Stripe. Raffles, like 50 / 50 tickets, are considered a "Restricted Business" that we are not licensed for. If we find that you are using online payments to sell raffle tickets, your club's ability to process online payments through Stripe will be disabled immediately. If you want to do this, you'll need to switch to SportsPay, which can be found in your Club dropdown -> Stripe section.

Canadian based clubs can find the list of Stripe's "Restricted Businesses" here: <https://stripe.com/en-ca/restricted-businesses>

U.S. based clubs can find the list of Stripe's "Restricted Businesses" here: <https://stripe.com/restricted-businesses>

### Can we sell prize pool fees on Curling IO?[​](#can-we-sell-prize-pool-fees-on-curling-io "Direct link to Can we sell prize pool fees on Curling IO?")

It depends on which of our payment processors (credit card processors) you are using. If you are using SportsPay, then in general yes, prize pools should not be an issue. If you are using Stripe, then no, absolutely not, since this is categorized as a resitrcted business.

Prize pools where winners are rewarded money are considered a Stripe "Restricted Business" that we are not licensed for. If we find that you are using online payments to sell prize pool fees, your club's ability to process online payments through Stripe will be disabled immediately. If you want to do this, you'll need to switch to SportsPay, which can be found in your Club dropdown -> Stripe section.

### Refund doesn't show up on the curler's statement[​](#refund-doesnt-show-up-on-the-curlers-statement "Direct link to Refund doesn't show up on the curler's statement")

Assuming the refund was issued correctly by club staff (to the correct order), there are a couple reasons it may not show up on the curler's credit card statement.

1. Refunds can take up to 7 days to process. Even then, there could be a further one or two day delay before the curler's bank reflects the refund. If the refund was made recently, please ask them to wait until at least 7 days have passed before contacting support.
2. Often if a partial refund is made quickly after the initial payment, it's common that the curler's bank will reflect the refund as a reduced payment by subtracting the refund amount from the original payment. For example, a payment of $200 is made followed by a partial refund of $100 within a few days, the eventual credit card statement may show a total payment of $100 instead of both a payment of $200 and a refund of $100, resulting in the same outcome. Please ask them to double check the amount of initial transaction / payment.

### Can we shift our season start date from July 1st?[​](#can-we-shift-our-season-start-date-from-july-1st "Direct link to Can we shift our season start date from July 1st?")

Yes, but there are a few things to keep in mind:

* The season start date must be on the first day of the month. E.g. July 1st
* You will want to pick and maintain the same season start date. Switching this around more than once may create some overlap in your seasonal fees (where curlers paid twice or not at all).
* Age restrictions for your leagues, fees, and discounts can be configured separately from your season start date using the [Age Calculation setting](/docs/club-management/settings.md#age-cutoff). By default, ages are calculated as of the day before your season starts, but you can change this to use a custom cutoff month (e.g., December 31st like Curl BC) or to calculate ages at registration time.
* You may end up collecting inaccurate affiliate fees. Sometimes your membership association fees will change between seasons, and you could be taking registrations (and collecting fees) before your MA has had a chance to update them. Curling IO cannot assume responsibility for inaccurate fees, so you may want to check with your membership association before changing your season start date.

You can change your season start date in the [club settings section](/docs/club-management/settings.md#season-start).

### How do age restrictions work?[​](#how-do-age-restrictions-work "Direct link to How do age restrictions work?")

Age restrictions on leagues, programs, fees, and discounts use your club's [Age Calculation setting](/docs/club-management/settings.md#age-cutoff). You have three options for how ages are calculated:

**Before season begins (Default):** Ages are calculated as of the day before your season starts. This is the simplest option and works well for most clubs. Ages remain consistent throughout the season.

**Custom cutoff month:** Ages are calculated as of the last day of the month before your selected cutoff month. This is useful when you want to align with age categories used by other organizations (e.g., Curl BC uses December 31).

**Registration date:** Ages are calculated based on when the curler registers. This is useful for "must be 18 to register" type requirements where the registration date matters.

**Note:** Waivers always use the curler's age at the time of registration and are not affected by this setting.

# Premium Tier

**[If your club is accepting online payments then you are already considered premium tier.](/docs/getting-started/premium.md)**

## What is Premium Tier?[​](#what-is-premium-tier "Direct link to What is Premium Tier?")

Premium tier clubs gain access to the non-essential but convenient benefits and features listed here.

**There is no obligation to join premium tier. All clubs retain access to Curling IO's core functionality regardless.**

If your club is not accepting online payments there will be an option to purchase one year of premium access for your club. Upon purchase, premium features are unlocked for all of your club's users.

* Only purchasable by clubs who are NOT accepting online payments.
* Not a subscription and will not auto-renew.
* Need to purchase it again every year to continue using premium features.
* There is a 2 month window where you can re-purchase before it expires, and have another year added to your expiry date.
* **There are no refunds for premium tier.**

### Why have a Premium Tier?[​](#why-have-a-premium-tier "Direct link to Why have a Premium Tier?")

Our premium tier features and benefits all have an outsized cost, whether it's infrastructure or support. Since nothing is actually free, we have to pay for this using revenue generated by our paying clubs. Essentially the free option is subsidized by our paying clubs.

That being said, we firmly believe that having a functional free option of Curling IO is important, and this means we must keep our operating costs to a minimum. We believe that having a premium tier to limit our costs is a fair solution, since none of these premium features are essential to benefit from Curling IO.

We also want to build new, potentially resource intensive features without worrying about how much it will cost us to offer them for free.

## Premium Tier Benefits[​](#premium-tier-benefits "Direct link to Premium Tier Benefits")

### Priority Support[​](#priority-support "Direct link to Priority Support")

**What you get:**

* Full double-entry bookkeeping (every transaction has balanced debits and credits)
* Accrual accounting (revenue recognized when order placed, not when paid)
* Automatic journal entries for orders, payments, and refunds
* Balance sheet tracking (Accounts Receivable, HST Payable, etc.)
* Dedicated Accounting Transactions report with CSV export
* Sequential payment allocation with partial refund tracking

All clubs can use basic [Accounting Codes](/docs/accounting/accounting-codes.md) to categorize revenue items. Premium clubs get the full accounting transactions system for complete integration with accounting software like QuickBooks, Xero, or Sage.

If your club loses premium access, no new accounting transactions will be recorded, but existing transactions remain accessible in your reports.

[See our Accounting Transactions documentation to learn more.](/docs/accounting/accounting-transactions.md)

### MailChimp Integration[​](#mailchimp-integration "Direct link to MailChimp Integration")

## How can we offer all of these essentials for free?[​](#how-can-we-offer-all-of-these-essentials-for-free "Direct link to How can we offer all of these essentials for free?")

It's simple really. We have an extremely robust and optimized multi-tenant infrastructure that minimizes the per-club costs of our essential feature set. We don't need to perform a bunch of setup tasks, or spin up new servers when we add a club.

In addition, everytime an online payment is processed through Curling IO, we get to keep a sliver of the processing fees. With so many clubs, we're able to generate enough revenue to subsidize the infrastructure costs of our *free clubs* while also paying for new feature development.

# Setup for Membership Associations

## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

**This document is only relevant to membership associations.**

As a membership association, any of your clubs that are using Curling IO for registrations are collecting membership data that you can access in your member reports.

For clubs that are not yet using Curling IO you can ask them to easily import their membership data using Curling IO by following the instructions in this document.

## Club Setup[​](#club-setup "Direct link to Club Setup")

You can access each club's member import area though the Clubs report.

1. Click on "Reports" in your top navigation bar.
2. Click on the "Clubs" report.
3. Click on the non-active club (active just means they are using Curling IO for registrations)
4. Login using the same account you are using to access your membership association's admin area.

You should now see the member import screen for the club.

You will want to add one or more of the club's managers so that they can also access this area and upload their membership data.

2. Enter the manager's name and email address.
3. Click the "Create Manager" button.

## Checklist[​](#checklist "Direct link to Checklist")

* [Add club specific managers](/docs/club-management/managers.md) to each of your non-active clubs so they can upload their membership data every season.
* Make sure each of these clubs watch the [member data import tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yPdn-sGWuQ\&t=1s).
* You are responsible for supporting these non-active clubs, so please make sure you also watch the [member data import tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yPdn-sGWuQ\&t=1s).
* Make sure your clubs know that Curling IO also provides [registration and event management features they can use for free!](/docs/getting-started/curling-club-managers.md)
